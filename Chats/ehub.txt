You don't know who you may help have a more productive day with your simple words. You will be informed the night before by the admin that you are up(selection is random), your message should come between 5-9am the next morning. It's a few seconds ting, so pls no excuses.

What matters in life is how consistent and persistent you are in reaching your goal.

05/10/2017, 10:43 am - Chika Nels: Police officials confirmed the authenticity of the photographs of the scene at the gunman’s hotel suite.

From his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, the gunman, who was identified by the police as Stephen Paddock, used rapid-fire weapons to shoot at concertgoers at a music festival.

At least three AR-15-style rifles were visible on the floor and on the furniture, along with at least a dozen high-capacity magazines, which can hold up to 100 rounds. (A standard American infantry soldier's magazine is 30 rounds.)

AR-15-style rifles are a civilian variant of a standard service rifle used by the American military for more than a half-century. Unlike the military versions, they support only semiautomatic fire.

Two of the rifles were outfitted with medium-magnification scopes and two-legged supports, known as bipods, attached to the undersides of the weapons. These additions would have helped Mr. Paddock target specific individuals.

At least one of the weapons in the photographs appears to have been modified with a “bump stock,” a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire rounds faster, at a rate similar to a fully automatic weapon. Officials said that 12 of the rifles found in the suite were outfitted with bump stocks. The diagram below only shows the location of the guns that were visible in photos and videos.
05/10/2017, 10:44 am - Chika Nels: <Media omitted>
05/10/2017, 10:45 am - Chika Nels: Mr. Paddock brought at least 10 suitcases into his hotel suite over a period of time, the police said. More than 20 guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were also found in the suite.

The suite was at the end of a hallway, with windows facing the concert grounds. A composite image of hotel photos, below, shows the layout and furniture of a similar suite with a different view. The image is flipped from its original perspective to match the orientation of the gunman’s suite
05/10/2017, 10:46 am - Chika Nels: <Media omitted>
05/10/2017, 10:46 am - Chika Nels: Police officials said they found two video cameras in the hallway, including one on a service cart, and a third over the suite door’s peephole.

A hotel worker said that Mr. Paddock checked in on Thursday and kept the “Do Not Disturb” sign on his door for the next three days.

Mr. Paddock used a hammerlike device to break two windows on the 32nd floor, and he fired on the concertgoers about 400 yards away.

06/10/2017, 9:35 am - Chika Nels: *A CURE TO HIV/AIDS in view*
_Lock HIV in reservoir cells, to die through apoptosis_

With the successful suppression of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) virus (HIV) through medication, the focus turns toward its eradication.

Researchers from Kumamoto University in Japan have developed a new compound that is key to the destruction of HIV. When the compound is introduced into infected cells, viral budding (release) is suppressed thereby confining it within the host cells. The cells then die naturally through apoptosis (cell death). It is hoped that this treatment will lead to the complete recovery from AIDS in the near future.

The study titled “A clue to unprecedented strategy to HIV eradication: “Lock-in and apoptosis” was published October 2, 2017, in the journal Scientific Reports.

In recent years, multi-drug therapy has made it possible to suppress HIV multiplication in the body when taken properly. This method, however, cannot remove the virus particles of the latent HIV reservoir — non-replicating virus particles that remain dormant in the cells of the body. As soon as drug administration is stopped, the viral load will again increase in the body. Removal of the viral reservoir is currently the top goal in AIDS research.

The “kick and kill” approach, which was developed several years ago, is a strategy for killing reservoir cells. This technique uses a drug that targets the reservoir cells and activates the virus, which then allows the immune system to find these cell using the activated virus as a landmark. Although this approach was clinically tested, there is still the problem of not being able to efficiently deactivate the virus after successful activation.

Researchers at Kumamoto University developed a new approach that they call “Lock-in and apoptosis.” First, they synthesized the compound L-HIPPO, which binds strongly to the HIV protein Pr55Gag and suppresses viral budding. When L-HIPPO was added to virus-infected cells via a carrier called α-CDE, the virus became confined within the cell and the cell would die through natural apoptosis.

“Unfortunately, this approach is not immediately available for people infected with HIV,” said Associate Professor Mikako Fujita of Kumamoto University, one of the leaders of the study. “First, we have to improve upon the drugs that activate the virus and combine them with L-HIPPO to efficiently target the viral reservoir. This would be a big step towards a complete recovery from HIV. We believe that our research will help to completely eradicate AIDS.”

06/10/2017, 3:45 pm - Chika Nels: *Monkeypox disease: What to know*

Are there rodents in your vicinity? Do you live
in Nigeria or anywhere in West or Central
Africa? Then you should care about
monkeypox.
Yes , it was first identified in laboratory
monkeys, hence the name, but it ’s actively
transmitted to humans by rodents or primates
and by a secondary human -to- human
transmission.
So how do you get it ?
1. It ’s infectious meaning it can come to you.
The monkeypox virus is transmitted via
contact with an infected animal ’ s blood, flesh ,
bite, or an infected human .
2. It ’s a virus . Viral infections are generally
harder to treat than bacteria ’s and the
monkeypox virus is a rare type.
3. It can cause fatal illnesses and quick deaths ,
especially in younger age groups .
4. It has NO treatment or vaccine but
outbreaks can be controlled .
5. The incubation period is 5 -21 days .
Symptoms typically last 14 – 21 days with
severe cases occurring among children with
longer virus exposure.
6. Monkeypox virus can only be diagnosed
definitively in the laboratory by a number of
different tests .
Symptoms
It manifests as various stages of rash and an
intense weakness among other things . Rashes ,
ranging from a few to several thousands ,
begins on the face, then palms and feet soles .
The lesions ( or rashes ) later become fluid-
filled blisters and lastly crusts which can affect
the oral membranes , genitalia , eyelids and
eyeballs.
What do you do?
1. Cook animal flesh or blood properly before
consuming. Monkeypox virus remain active in
infected primates or rodent even after their
death.
2. Stay away from body fluids , lesions ,
respiratory tract secretions , or objects recently
contaminated by monkeypox patients .
Transmission occurs via droplets respiratory
particles.
3. Don’ t pick up stray animals especially if you
live in the tropics .
4. Immediately quarantine infected animals or
humans. Close physical contact is a significant
risk factor and protective equipment must be
worn while providing care for patients .
5. Regular handwashing is encouraged.
6. If you have been in the proximity of an
infected person , go for definitive testing in the
laboratory.7 . Spread the awareness by

06/10/2017, 8:55 pm - Dbkoncept: No intent brov.
06/10/2017, 8:55 pm - Dbkoncept: U said u gained one or two
06/10/2017, 8:56 pm - Dbkoncept: Maybe that will boost people's moral
06/10/2017, 8:56 pm - Dbkoncept: If you elucidate on what you gained
06/10/2017, 8:57 pm - Chika Nels: The e-work experience platform is a *massive* learning/ training platform. It started as Digital bananas Abroad( their main headquarters) and came to Nigeria about 3years ago as E-work experience. The platform helps to groom individuals to becoming a professional *Business Analyst and/or Project manager* utilizing its unique working model.
06/10/2017, 9:01 pm - Dbkoncept: Chikah is typing...
06/10/2017, 9:02 pm - Chika Nels: This model involved learning via the e-work experience platform( website) were a lot of materials( slides, articles, video clips) will be made available for you to utilise. Occassional tests and exams, you will also be assigned a mentor in that area(project management or business analysis) to guide you. As time goes on, You will also be involved in their real life projects, contracted to them by certain companies. The main essence is to be a professional in all respect( with hands on experience).
There will be occasional online meetings that helps easy communication with other people on that platform, like minds.
06/10/2017, 9:03 pm - Chika Nels: I will check for my old notes and take some pics to give you an idea of what's involved.
06/10/2017, 9:04 pm - Karo: 🤔
06/10/2017, 9:06 pm - Chika Nels: At the end of the day, when you have attained the Professional level, it implies that you can be a mentor to the new guys coming on that platform. You will then be paid for every newbie you mentor, every job you participate in. More jobs will come in either to a team or you personally.
06/10/2017, 9:08 pm - Chika Nels: The cycle continues, newbies learn to reach the mentor level and are involved in several projects as they advance. The job becomes flexible when you reach that mentor stage, you decide how long you want to work, which is proportional to how much you make.
06/10/2017, 9:08 pm - Chika Nels: Now
06/10/2017, 9:12 pm - Karo: Maybe you should have written the article for them
06/10/2017, 9:13 pm - Chika Nels: At the end of the day, you are giving a certificate and all. 
They would help you draft a professional Cv/ resume effectively highlighting all the experience you have had on the platform and the real life projects you have been involved in which would double your chances of securing a job as a PM or a BA in any company home and abroad. They can also refer you to companies that may need your expertise and there is a 90% chance that you'll be picked. I didn't finish the program bcos that (securing a job) wasnt why I joined. However a lot of learning goes on it that platform and I will highly recommend anyone interested in learning along that line (PM or BA) or securing a job in that area.
06/10/2017, 9:14 pm - Chika Nels: Think, I have answered that question
06/10/2017, 9:16 pm - Chika Nels: You will be involved in several real life projects contracted from big companies usually banks, like FBN etc. You will work with like minds, some more experienced than you are. All working together to achieve a goal... And there would be many of these projects in the long run.
06/10/2017, 9:16 pm - Chika Nels: Lolz..

06/10/2017, 9:20 pm - Chika Nels: <Media omitted>
06/10/2017, 9:23 pm - Chika Nels: Not really "legal" to share this tho. You usually sign a non-closure agreement online before you begin. Agreeing to not share knowledge of the details projects you are involved in or try to clone it and most importantly not (download their videos, and most-most importantly 😅not duplicate their working model i.e the e-work experience platform in any respect for the next 5 years)
06/10/2017, 9:25 pm - Chika Nels: So, I hope with this few points of mine😅 that I have clarified the seeming BS in that article. 
I rest my case😌

06/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Chijioke: The PR approach of the publication is a little off
06/10/2017, 9:27 pm - Chijioke: And for a company that seems well directed from all you've said that's surprising
06/10/2017, 9:27 pm - Chijioke: Maybe na the Commissioner wey show up, wey confuse them

07/10/2017, 4:32 pm - Ede: For the JS guys in the house, how can you access the action attribute of an html form without jQuery?
07/10/2017, 4:38 pm - Chijioke: document.getElementById("idoftheform").action
07/10/2017, 4:39 pm - Babajide Martins: 🤦🏿‍♂
07/10/2017, 4:39 pm - Chijioke: Also to really understand what's happening use .getAttribute("action")
07/10/2017, 4:40 pm - Chijioke: Somewhere in the bytecode of new JS interpreters getAttribute is equated to the element itself causing it to reflect directly it's resulting values
07/10/2017, 4:40 pm - Chijioke: Thus I think officially getAttribute was deprecated
07/10/2017, 4:40 pm - Chijioke: It's not the only way tho
07/10/2017, 4:42 pm - Chijioke: There's 
document.getElementByTagName
document.forms
document.getElementByClass 
and all sha
07/10/2017, 4:42 pm - Chijioke: There's also some complex selectors for it but the first is sufficient
07/10/2017, 4:44 pm - Ede: I mn in node js
07/10/2017, 4:45 pm - Ede: Not frontend something
07/10/2017, 4:46 pm - Chijioke: You said "attribute", does any version of node.js use html?
07/10/2017, 4:46 pm - Chijioke: Ohh
07/10/2017, 4:46 pm - Chijioke: You mean in the server?
07/10/2017, 4:46 pm - Chijioke: The action attribute is always contained in a header
07/10/2017, 4:47 pm - Chijioke: At least in Java, Python, and PHP
07/10/2017, 4:47 pm - Chijioke: It's essentially the method
07/10/2017, 4:48 pm - Chijioke: *'s page
07/10/2017, 4:49 pm - Chijioke: Or check the current scripts path,

07/10/2017, 5:00 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Priority Unconscious

By Pius Adesanmi.

Ondo state government has approved N390 million to purchase vehicles for lawmakers. (Tunji, I know I owe you a response to the other thread. Bear with me). I am enjoying the respite that Ondo is providing for Kogi in national news.

What I want to draw the country's attention to is not the approval of the funds per se. Buying cars for lawmakers at the National and State Assemblies is a sufficiently routine aspect of our national monkey pox disease of free lunch for government officials.  I know of no other democracy where lawmakers enjoy this free lunch. In many cases, lawmakers take the bus or the train to work. I recently told a lawmaker here about the convoy, police orderlies, perks and allowances of his counterparts in my country and he looked at me, smiled, and said I must write great fiction.

I must concede that in some instances, state governments even make nice by saying that it is a loan to be repaid by the lawmakers. I don't know if this is the case in Ondo. Whenever this happens, it is usually a ruse and lie. Nobody pays anything back. And they leave and steal the cars at the end of their term.

Like I said, I am not on Ondo's case per se today. This one is a national disease. The latest outbreak only happened by chance in Ondo this week. By next week, two or three other states should be announcing new vehicle budgets for lawmakers. State legislature in Nigeria is generally a charade. Governors buy the entire house with free lunch. Many of them already swear fealty to the Governor before they are sworn in. 

Recently, in one of our states, a Speaker was angry that a journalist dared to ask if they would rubber stamp the Governor's agendas. We will not rubber stamp. We are His Excellency's rubber stamp, he stated. In other words, a rubber stamp is not an instrument we shall wield for for His Excellency. We are rubber stamps that His Excellency shall wield at his pleasure.

I keep digressing sha! I am interested, today, in the architecture of the report in Premium Times and a few other papers. Now, I have no idea if this was the making of the group of Ondo commissioners who addressed a press conference after the executive meeting in which the free lunch for the lawmakers was announced. Perhaps it was the journalists who structured the report that way?

Anyway sha, between the Ondo commissioners and the journalists who published their presser, a glimpse of the Nigerian Priority Unconscious (If you like difficult critical theory and reading, read the classic book, The Political Unconscious by Frederic Jameson) emerges.

You are already familiar with Nigeria's priority unconscious. That is what we all spend our lives complaining about but we don't seem to find a solution not because we don't know what to do but because Nigeria is divided into those currently benefiting from the priority unconscious and those hoping and praying to join them. There is really no national will to change the dynamics.

In the Premium Times reports, "Akeredolu Approves N390 million Vehicles for Ondo Lawmakers", there are exactly twenty paragraphs. The first 20 paragraphs are devoted entirely to the lawmakers and their new vehicles.

In the middle of the article, there is this transition which speaks to who we are and why we are in deep shit:

"Besides the vehicles, the state government also reached a decision to raise a matching fund of N3.9 billion to be able to access the funds from the Universal Basic Education Commission(UBEC) for revamping the education sector in the state."

Education takes five paragraphs in total. Another transition to roads. Roads take the last five paragraphs.

Priority Unconscious:

First ten paragraphs - free lunch (cars) for lawmakers
five paragraphs - education
five paragraphs - roads.

Like I said, there is no way of telling if this is the order in which the commissioners spoke or if this is how they prioritized things in their presser (I certainly expect Tunji and other savvy political spokespersons to milk this loophole and argue that education was the top priority - only those yeye journalists turned around and made it look like fee lunch for lawmakers was the priority of the meeting).

Whether prioritizing happened this way at the meeting o, or it was the commissioners who inadvertently reordered priorities at their presser o, or it was the journalists who left Akure and reordered the priority of the state government in their own minds, we have ended up with a rather fascinating glimpse of the Nigerian priority unconscious.

Of course the Federal priority unconscious is worse. Listen to the Ministers when they address the media after a Federal Executive Council meeting and you will weep.

If the priority unconscious in your own state is not exactly what we see here via Premium Times or even much worse, cast the first stone at Ondo.

07/10/2017, 9:37 pm - Akolab: Because When you add any two digits you can possibly get a number greater than 198
07/10/2017, 9:38 pm - Akolab: 2. Since M and E are different that means that the addends can't be 99
07/10/2017, 9:39 pm - Sammah: Ko ye mi o🤦🏽‍♀
07/10/2017, 9:39 pm - Akolab: Thanks for that
07/10/2017, 9:40 pm - Akolab: 99
+
99
_____
198
07/10/2017, 9:41 pm - Sammah: Ok
07/10/2017, 9:41 pm - Akolab: This can't be the solution because in the rule of Alphametics the same number must be represented by the same alphabet
07/10/2017, 9:41 pm - Akolab: Do you get it??
07/10/2017, 9:42 pm - Kado: functional brain 🙈
07/10/2017, 9:42 pm - Tosin Lawal: 50+50 =100
07/10/2017, 9:42 pm - Akolab: 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
07/10/2017, 9:42 pm - Akolab: Chop prouding
07/10/2017, 9:43 pm - Sammah: Yes boss
07/10/2017, 9:43 pm - Tosin Lawal: Oya 🙌🏾🙌🏾
07/10/2017, 9:44 pm - Akolab: Here E + E = E
07/10/2017, 9:44 pm - Akolab: Can anyone think of a number that you add to itself and you still get the number
07/10/2017, 9:46 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Zero
07/10/2017, 9:46 pm - Chika Nels: Similar to this?
07/10/2017, 9:46 pm - Akolab: Nice zero
07/10/2017, 9:46 pm - Chika Nels: ?
07/10/2017, 9:46 pm - Akolab: That means that E is Zero
07/10/2017, 9:46 pm - Chika Nels: Okay
07/10/2017, 9:47 pm - Dinah: Zero
07/10/2017, 9:47 pm - Akolab: M *0*
+
M *0*
____
B *0* *0*
07/10/2017, 9:47 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Sounds like the Yoruba pronunciation... *"Eziro."*
07/10/2017, 9:48 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Iziro*
07/10/2017, 9:48 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Chika n Samah stuvs
07/10/2017, 9:48 pm - Sammah: @2349064355166 noooo🤦🏽‍♀
07/10/2017, 9:48 pm - Chika Nels: 🤣🤣
07/10/2017, 9:48 pm - Akolab: This means that M is a number such that when we add it to itself we get a *0* as the last digit
07/10/2017, 9:49 pm - Chika Nels: Yeah
07/10/2017, 9:49 pm - Akolab: Those any number comes to mind
07/10/2017, 9:49 pm - Chika Nels: 5?
07/10/2017, 9:49 pm - Akanni Hafeez: 5
07/10/2017, 9:50 pm - Akolab: Gbam
07/10/2017, 9:50 pm - Akolab: Correct
07/10/2017, 9:50 pm - Akolab: That means M is 5
07/10/2017, 9:50 pm - Sammah: My ntw dou😥
07/10/2017, 9:50 pm - Akolab: And B is 1
07/10/2017, 9:50 pm - Chika Nels: Yep
07/10/2017, 9:50 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Sorry
07/10/2017, 9:51 pm - Chika Nels: Pele dear
07/10/2017, 9:51 pm - Akolab: So the Alphametics was simply
50  + 50 is 100
07/10/2017, 9:52 pm - Akolab: Let's see you who will solve get this first
07/10/2017, 9:52 pm - Akolab: Price: Airtime Worth 200
07/10/2017, 9:52 pm - Akolab: Solve the Alphametics
07/10/2017, 9:52 pm - Chika Nels: Wawu
07/10/2017, 9:53 pm - Akanni Hafeez: I've not followed too well o.
07/10/2017, 9:53 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Chika we go share the airtime.😉😉😉
07/10/2017, 9:53 pm - Akolab: NO + Gun + NO = HUNT

07/10/2017, 10:11 pm - Chika Nels: Good one there.
07/10/2017, 10:11 pm - Akolab: Yes
07/10/2017, 10:12 pm - Akolab: Alphametics used for message encryption actually requires a key phrase or code
07/10/2017, 10:12 pm - Mosad: Only?
07/10/2017, 10:12 pm - Akolab: Without it, it's impossible to understand
07/10/2017, 10:12 pm - Akolab: Nope it's also used in bar codes
07/10/2017, 10:13 pm - Mosad: Oh!  Just like what we watch in movies.  They need a key to decode a message
07/10/2017, 10:13 pm - Akolab: Which is my next and final topic
07/10/2017, 10:13 pm - Mosad: 🤔

07/10/2017, 10:19 pm - Akanni Hafeez: I'm interested too o.
07/10/2017, 10:19 pm - Akolab: Beginning and end are two long narrow lines with a narrow gap between
07/10/2017, 10:20 pm - Chika Nels: Okay
07/10/2017, 10:20 pm - Akolab: The middle symbol is a narrow gap followed by a narrow line then a narrow gap, a narrow line and a final gap
07/10/2017, 10:21 pm - Akolab: The digits are encoded into sequence for each side of the middle symbol
07/10/2017, 10:22 pm - Chika Nels: Yeah.. Then 291
07/10/2017, 10:22 pm - Akolab: Yes sir
07/10/2017, 10:22 pm - Akolab: <Media omitted>
07/10/2017, 10:24 pm - Akolab: As you can seen 0 represents black
07/10/2017, 10:24 pm - Akolab: 1 represents white
07/10/2017, 10:24 pm - Akolab: So if I have 00110
07/10/2017, 10:25 pm - Akolab: It's means I would have a double with of black color followed by and equal with of white
07/10/2017, 10:25 pm - Sammah: Wahala dey o....this is d 3rd time I'm going back
07/10/2017, 10:25 pm - Akolab: Then a slightly less thicker width of black

07/10/2017, 10:41 pm - Akolab: Yes
07/10/2017, 10:42 pm - Akolab: So to solve bar code problems
07/10/2017, 10:42 pm - Akolab: U need to first identify the beginning
07/10/2017, 10:42 pm - Akolab: Middle
07/10/2017, 10:42 pm - Akolab: And end
07/10/2017, 10:45 pm - Akolab: Then know that everything on the left starts with 0 I.e white and ends with 1 i.e black
07/10/2017, 10:45 pm - Akolab: The reverse is for the right hand side
07/10/2017, 10:46 pm - Akolab: Then each letter is a distinct set of 2 blacks and 2 whites
07/10/2017, 10:46 pm - Chika Nels: Exactly
07/10/2017, 10:46 pm - Akolab: I. Ẹ for left we have WBWB
07/10/2017, 10:46 pm - Akolab: And for right we have BWBW
07/10/2017, 10:47 pm - Akolab: The thinnest line is a 1 digit
07/10/2017, 10:48 pm - Akolab: The thicker one is a 11
07/10/2017, 10:48 pm - Akolab: The the thickest is a 111
07/10/2017, 10:48 pm - Akolab: This is alsi the same for gaps or whites representing 0
07/10/2017, 10:49 pm - Akolab: Do you get that very well??
07/10/2017, 10:49 pm - Akolab: Any confusion??

07/10/2017, 11:03 pm - Chika Nels: Eleyi Gidi gan o
07/10/2017, 11:03 pm - Sammah: Hmmn
07/10/2017, 11:05 pm - Akolab: Why not just write out the values of each of the gaps and blacks then group 4, 4
07/10/2017, 11:06 pm - Akolab: Anyways with that we have concluded the topic for today
07/10/2017, 11:06 pm - Akolab: Send me your answers am still here

Nokia – The Fall of a Giant

This was Forbes cover page 10 years ago when Nokia clearly ruled the mobile phone market from the late 1990s until 2011!

Nokia had a 14-year run as the world's top handset maker. The world’s No. 1 mobile maker and the first brand of phone everyone owned. The word ‘Nokia’ became a generic term for ‘mobile phone.’ 

NOKIA IN 2007
Nokia was number 5 among the worlds 100 global brands in 2007
It had a 40% share of the global mobile phone. In the fourth quarter alone, Nokia sold 133.5 million handsets compared to Samsung selling 46.5 million units (14%), Motorola sold 40.9 million (12.3%), Sony Ericsson 30.9 Million (9.3%), LG 23.6M (7.1%). Apple sold only 2.3 million iPhones (0.69%), during the same period.

A pioneer in the smartphone industry, when the world moved from regular phones to smart phones, literally introducing consumers to the smartphone with its initial Symbian series and had over 70% market share as at 2007. 

NOKIA IN 2017

Over 80% of all smartphones are on Android OS! Nokia had dumped its Symbian OS (which had 0.1% market share in 2015) and shifted to Windows.
By first quarter of 2017, Nokia had less than 0.3% of the market share with Samsung Dominating with 22.8% (79 million units) and Apple 15% (52 million units). 

Nokia is now out of the 100 global brands!

WHAT WENT WRONG?
- INNOVATION: Nokia failed to match the innovation that was needed to retain its dominance of the Smartphone Market. More and more consumers opted for pocket-sized mini-computers instead of "feature" phones with tedious WAP browsers. 
In 2007, apple introduced its iPhone with its full touchscreen and app-based operating system, and it changed the very definition of what a smartphone should be. Nokia failed to respond to the iPhone and the shifting consumer demand that came with it. 
Samsung, on the other hand, responded swiftly. Not only was Samsung speedy, it also bet on multiple platforms, including android and windows phone – and it even had its own homegrown OS, Bada, just in case none of the others worked out. The Android paid off handsomely.

- OVERCONFIDENCE: Nokia’s business was going on well in the mid-2000s, with massive profits keeping their shareholders happy and clamouring for more of the same. But this made it harder for them to change their business to react to the looming threats from internet-focused companies. The new entrants Apple and Google were seen as low threat because of their inexperience in the phone business. Nokia’s biased assessment of the competition makes its products always seemed better than the competition so nothing to learn from them

- TECHNOLOGY: Nokia’s was ill prepared for the dramatic change in required hardware and software competence. The Nokia core competence was in radio technology hardware, while smartphones needed computer and software competence, competence in touch screen interfaces – and user experience design skills.

- VOICE OF THE CUSTOMER: Nokia was comfortable with the Status quo and was not willing to make the needed disruptive changes to respond to the yearnings of its existing customers and win future customers 

WHAT ABOUT BLACBERRY?

BlackBerry’s failure to keep up with Apple and Android was a consequence of errors in its strategy and vision. 
First, after growing to dominate the corporate market, BlackBerry failed to anticipate that consumers — not business customers — would drive the smartphone revolution. 

Second, BlackBerry was blindsided by the emergence of the “app economy,” which drove massive adoption of iPhone and Android-based devices. 

Third, BlackBerry failed to realize that smartphones would evolve beyond mere communication devices to become full-fledged mobile entertainment hubs.

Blackberry now account for only 0.048% of the smartphone market share selling 207,900 units.

ALL HOPE IS NOT LOST FOR NOKIA
Well, unlike Blackberry, all hope is not lost for Nokia as they have launched a comeback!

Last year, HMD Global, which is made of ex-Nokia execs, partnered with Foxconn to introduce Nokia 6, Nokia 5, Nokia 3 and the revamped 3310. It is hoped that these new products will give them the needed boost for the comeback!

CONCLUSION
Even a company that was on top and dominating its market was surprisingly vulnerable and fell from the top to bottom in a period of less than 7 years. 

Businesses can learn from the Nokia story and prevent same by strategically focusing on the Voice of the Customer and innovation coming from competitors within and outside the industry and respond with rigorous Continuous Improvement in their processes and products!

08/10/2017, 11:02 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Nope. If the educational system really responsible for all the successful entrepreneurs there are, maybe I'd agree. Whilst the educational system should do what the point here tries to put forth as a "fail." Most entrepreneurs didn't need nothing from the educational system to succeed. In fact the get studied n replicated back into the educational system. 

Or maybe this point ain't well laid sef cos the explanation given it is that lucid...

Entrepreneurship is a system which is not included in a curriculum of The educational system,, They are personal skills acquired by people who are  business oriented..
Entrepreneurship is a vast concept that cannot be Confined Or brought to subjection under "An Educational system"
  This is because we have millions of entrepreneurs out there ,,Both quacks and Certified..
  That is why we have Business school and Foundations and initiatives that enlightens and educates aspiring or Working Entrepreneurs

10/10/2017, 10:24 am - Akolab: There was a Bus Conductor, who was Very Rude to his passengers. 😡 😡 😡 😡
One day, a Beautiful Young Girl, of around 18 Years, tried to board the bus, but he didn't stop
the bus.
Unfortunately, the beautiful young girl fell under the bus and died on the spot. 😫 😫 😫 😫 😫
Angry passengers  😡 😡 😡 😡took the conductor to the police station, who in turn took him to the court.
The Judge was not at all impressed with him and gave him capital punishment. 😬 😬 😬 😬
He was taken to the electrocution chamber. There was a single chair in the center of the room. The conductor was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him. But, to everyone's amazement, he survived. The judge decided to set him free, and he returned to his profession.
.
A couple of months later, an elderly gentleman tried to board the bus.
This time the Bus conductor, remembering his earlier experience stopped the bus. Unfortunately, the elderly gentleman slipped and died due to his injuries. 
The conductor was taken to the police station and then to the court, to the same judge. 
Though, he hadn't done anything wrong, but considering his past record the judge decided to set an example and gave him capital punishment.
The Bus conductor was again taken to the same electrocution chamber where there was a single chair in the center of the room. He was strapped to the chair and high voltage current was given to him.
This time he died instantly.....!!!!!

The question is why didn't he die on the first occasion..?? but, died instantly the second time....??

Okay........ here is the Answer............
During the first time The Conductor was a Bad Conductor, therefore electricity didn't pass through him. But, during the second time, he was a Good Conductor, so electricity passed through him freely and he died !!!! Physics never goes wrong....

Once der is obstruction, d flow of blood is reduced. So there won't be enuf oxygen reaching d brain as d blood contains oxygen  and hence , stroke can occur. But av never heard of such link b4.

11/10/2017, 2:46 pm - ‪+233 20 991 0044‬: *Anemia*

Anemia is characterized by an impaired production of red blood cells. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen to our tissue as well as removing carbon dioxide, a waste product, from our tissues and eliminating it through the kidneys or lungs.

Anemia can become dangerous when oxygenation and waste elimination are impaired enough to cause a person to become symptomatic.

It has been known to cause permanent cognitive impairments and delayed physical development in infants if not addressed. The simple fix is typically supplemental iron.

However, if iron depletion is not the source of the problem, this can result in iron overload and still leave the person suffering from anemia and its effects. Therefore, it is extremely important to figure out the type and cause of each anemic case and address the underlying issue.
 
Causes of Anemia:

Excessive Bleeding
Leaky Gut
Low Stomach Acid
Iron Deficiency
B12 Deficiency
Folate Deficiency
Poor Diet
Chronic Diseases
Intestinal Disorders
Infections
Kidney Disease
Liver Disease
Thyroid Disease
Pregnancy
Enzyme Deficiencies
Autoimmunity

Best Food Sources of Iron:

1. Eat Liver

Liver is a great source of protein, iron, all of the B vitamins (including B12 and folate), balanced quantities of vitamin A, many trace elements and minerals including copper, zinc, chromium, phosphorous and selenium, essential fatty acids EPA, DHA and AA, as well as the powerful antioxidant CoQ10.

All of these compounds help to support the production of healthy red blood cells and fight disease.

2. Green leafy vegetables such as collard and spinach; egg yolk; dried fruits such as prunes and raisins; seafood – particularly clams, oysters and scallops; turkey or chicken.

-Vitamin B12 is found in:
1. Meat – must be organic from a holistic health point of view.
2. Egg yolks
3. Dairy products
4. B12 and Folic Acid Supplements

Every success story comes with a price. At a point, the last man standing didn't understand the race, all he knew was his dream. Getting to the top starts with realisation of who you are and what you can do. To every man is his potential, to every soul is a gift and for every day there is a survivor. Deep within you, you are a success! Don't give up!

The Sushruta Samhita documents cataract surgery. The patient had to look at the tip of his or her nose while the surgeon, holding the eyelids apart with thumb and index finger, used a needle-like instrument to pierce the eyeball from the side. It was then sprinkled with breast milk and the outside of the eye bathed with a herbal medication. The surgeon used the instrument to scrape out the clouded lens until the eye “assumed the glossiness of a resplendent cloudless sun”. During recovery it was important for the patient to avoiding coughing, sneezing, burping or anything else that might cause pressure in the eye. If the operation were a success, the patient would regain some useful vision, albeit unfocused.

Bounced email is an email that couldn’t be delivered. Specifically, it’s an explanation of delivery failure related to server or spam issues, whether they are permanent or temporary. Typically, it is a metric expressed as a percentage of subscribers who didn’t receive your message. There are two types of bounces: hard and soft.

The man above was called Will West, the man below William West, and they were both sentenced to jail at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas over 100 years ago.

The arrival of Will West in 1903 caused the records clerk at the prison considerable confusion, because he was convinced he'd processed him two years previously.

They even shared the same Bertillon measurements.

But Will West insisted to McClaughry that it was not him: ‘That’s my picture, but I don’t know where you got it, for I know I have never been here before.’

To McClaughry's shock, he was absolutely right, too. William West was a different person altogether and in fact had been admitted to the prison two years previously for murder.

The case highlighted the flaws in the Bertillon method and it wasn’t long before the U.S authorities turned to fingerprinting.

13/10/2017, 4:38 pm - Akanni Hafeez: [Debate for today}

 A man was selling his goat 🐐 and another man agreed to buy it. The man was using his last money  to buy the goat but as soon as he brought the money out to pay for the goat, the goat jumped and snatched the money from his hands and chewed all .Now the question is, who owns the goat ? The buyer or the seller. Pls analyze carefully Don't spoil the fun. Send to another group and see funny answers?....

13/10/2017, 5:40 pm - Chijioke: If the goats = the money brought from the purse and destroyed by the goat then he takes the goat
13/10/2017, 5:41 pm - Chijioke: If the money is lesser the buyer adds more, if more the seller pays the buyer more compensation

What is the best way to get real Instagram followers? by Matt Holmes https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-get-real-Instagram-followers/answers/41106056?share=2b56fa03&srid=3nUCF
14/10/2017, 10:56 pm - Chika Nels: Thanks for sharing boss.
14/10/2017, 10:58 pm - Chika Nels: Skip number 2 and 3. In fact don't consider it, it's not the best advice and won't reflect a good image about your brand
14/10/2017, 11:00 pm - Chika Nels: Instagress has already even been shut down by IG, April this year. 
Although another bot site is up, if you need to utilize it, use only for personal accounts not business pages or brands. 
*skip 2 and 3* in that article.
14/10/2017, 11:02 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Lmaooo those were even the points i was going to take serious the most😄😄

14/10/2017, 11:04 pm - Chika Nels: Loool, don't o
14/10/2017, 11:07 pm - Chika Nels: 😂
I won't advise that. It would definately have a negative effect for any business that utilize it. Imagine you post a pic about a lost friend or something and you see a comment by Samsung saying "cool" 
That's one small example of how these bots work.
14/10/2017, 11:09 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Lmaoo
14/10/2017, 11:10 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: I get dumb comments like that a lot on my IG... compliments that don't even relate with the picture

16/10/2017, 3:14 pm - ‪+233 20 991 0044‬: ⛔️Foods to Avoid During Pregnancy

Pregnancy is one of the most vital and delicate times in a woman's life.
Therefore, it is more important than ever to eat a healthy diet.
This means paying attention to what you eat, and making sure to avoid harmful foods and beverages.
Certain foods should only be consumed rarely, while others should be avoided completely.

1. Undercooked or Raw Fish

Raw fish can cause several infections. These include norovirus, Vibrio, Salmonella, Listeria and parasite.
Some of these infections only affect the mother, leaving her dehydrated and weak. Other infections may be passed on to the unborn baby with serious, or even fatal, consequences.
Pregnant women are especially susceptible to Listeria infections. In fact, pregnant women are up to 20 times more likely to get infected by Listeria than the general population.

2. Undercooked, Raw and Processed Meat

Eating undercooked or raw meat increases the risk of infection from several bacteria or parasites.
These include Toxoplasma, E. coli, Listeriaand Salmonella.
Bacteria may threaten the health of the unborn baby, possibly leading to stillbirth or severe neurological illnesses, including mental retardation, blindness and epilepsy.

3. Raw Eggs

Raw eggs can be contaminated with Salmonella.
Symptoms of Salmonella infections are usually experienced only by the mother.
They include fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea.
Pregnant women should always cook eggs thoroughly, or used pasteurized eggs.

4. Organ Meat

Organ meat is a great source of several nutrients. These include iron, vitamin B12, vitamin A and copper, all of which are good for an expectant mother and her child.
However, eating too much animal-based vitamin A (preformed vitamin A) is not recommended during pregnancy.
It may cause vitamin A toxicity, as well as abnormally high copper levels, which can result in birth defects and liver toxicity.
Therefore, pregnant women should not eat organ meat more often than once a week.

5. Caffeine

Caffeine is the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world, and is mainly found in coffee, tea, soft drinks and cocoa.
Pregnant women are generally advised to limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day, or about 2–3 cups of coffee.
Caffeine is absorbed very quickly, and passes easily into the placenta and fetus.
Because unborn babies and their placentas do not have the main enzyme needed to metabolize caffeine, high levels can build up.
High caffeine intake during pregnancy has been shown to restrict fetal growth and increase the risk of low birth weight at delivery.

16/10/2017, 6:42 pm - Dbkoncept: 1) What should a woman do if she finds herself alone in the company of a strange male as she enters a lift in a high-rise apartment or building late at night?
Experts say: Enter the lift. If you need to reach the 13th floor, press all the buttons up to your destination. No one will dare attack you in a lift that stops on every floor.

2) What to do if a stranger tries to attack you when you are alone in your house. Run to the kitchen.
Experts say: You alone know where the chili powder and turmeric are kept. And where the knives and plates are. All these can be turned into deadly weapons. If nothing else, start throwing plates and utensils all over. Let them break. Scream. Remember that noise is the greatest enemy of a molester. He does not want to be caught.

3) Taking a Taxi at Night.
Experts say: Before getting into an auto at night, note down its registration number. Then use the mobile to call your family or friend and pass on the details to them in the language the driver understands. Even if no one answers your call, pretend you are in a conversation. The driver now knows someone has his details and he will be in serious trouble if anything goes wrong. He is now bound to take you home safe and sound. A potential attacker is now your de facto protector!

4) What if the driver turns into a street he is not supposed to, and you feel you are entering a danger zone?
Experts say: Use the handle of your 👜 handbag or your stole to wrap around his neck and pull him back. Within seconds, he will feel choked and helpless. In case you don’t have a handbag or stole, just pull him back by his collar. The top button of his shirt would then do the same trick.

5) If you are stalked at night.
Expert say: enter a shop or a house and explain your predicament. If it is night and shops are not open, go inside an ATM box. ATM centers always have close circuit television (CCTV). Fearing identification, no one will dare attack you.

After all, being mentally alert is the greatest weapon you can ever have. 

Please forward to all the women you care about to spread awareness, as this is the least we can do for a social & moral cause and for the safety of our women.

Please, forward to your moms, sisters, relatives, lady friends, etc.

Better safe than sorry, right?

Nothing is completely off limits. Even items that you might think of as “the worst" could be occasional treats -- in tiny amounts. But they won’t help you nutrition-wise, and it’s easiest to manage your diabetes if you mainly stick to the “best” options.

1. Starches
Your body needs carbs. But you want to choose wisely. Use this list as a guide.

✅Best Choices
-Whole grains, such as brown rice, oatmeal, quinoa, millet, or amaranth
-Sweet potato
-Items made with whole grains and no (or very little) added sugar

⛔️Worst Choices
-Processed grains, such as white rice or white flour
-White bread
-French fries

2. Vegetables
Load up! You’ll get fiber and very little fat or salt (unless you add them).  Remember, potatoes and corn count as carbs.

✅Best Choices
-Fresh veggies, eaten raw or lightly steamed, roasted, or grilled
-Go for a variety of colors: dark greens, red or orange (think of carrots or red peppers), whites (onions) and even purple (eggplants). 2.5 cups of veggies per day.

⛔️Worst Choices
-Canned vegetables with lots of added sodium
-Veggies cooked with lots of added butter, cheese, or sauce

3. Fruits
and fiber. Most are naturally low in fat and sodium. But they tend to have more carbs than vegetables do.

✅Best Choices
-Fresh fruit

⛔️Worst Choices
-Canned fruit with heavy sugar syrup
-Regular jam, jelly, and preserves (unless you have a very small portion)
-Fruit punch, fruit drinks, fruit juice drinks(canned)

4. Protein
You have lots of choices, including beef, chicken, fish, turkey, seafood, beans, cheese, eggs and nuts.

✅Best Choices
-Plant-based proteins, such as beans, nuts
-Fish and seafood
-Chicken and other poultry

⛔️Worst Choices
-Fried meats
-Higher-fat cuts of meat
-Regular cheeses

5.Fats, Oils, and Sweets
They’re tough to resist. But it’s easy to get too much and gain weight, which makes it harder to manage your diabetes.

✅Best Choices
-Natural sources of vegetable fats, such as nuts, seeds, or avocados (high in calories, so keep portions small)
-Foods that give you omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna
-Plant-based oils, such as canola, grapeseed, or olive oil

⛔️Worst Choices
-Anything with artificial trans fat in it. It's bad for your heart. Check the ingredient list for anything that’s “partially hydrogenated,” even if the label says it has 0 grams of trans fat.
-Big portions of saturated fats, which mainly come from animal products but also are in coconut oil and palm oil. Ask your doctor what your limit should be, especially if you have heart disease as well as diabetes.

6.Drinks
When you down a favorite drink, you may get more calories, sugar, salt, or fat than you bargained for. Read the labels so you know what’s in a serving.

✅Best Choices
-Water
-Unsweetened tea (add a slice of lemon)
-Coffee, black or with added low-fat milk and sugar substitute

⛔️Worst Choices
-Regular sodas
-Sweetened tea
-Coffee with sugar and cream
-Flavored coffees and chocolate drinks
-Energy drinks

Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in your blood and in your cells. Your liver makes most of the cholesterol in your body. The rest comes from foods you eat. Cholesterol travels in your blood bundled up in packets called lipoproteins.

Cholesterol comes in two forms:

1. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the “bad,” unhealthy kind of cholesterol. LDL cholesterol can build up in your arteries and form fatty, waxy deposits called plaques.

2. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the “good,” healthy kind of cholesterol. It transports excess cholesterol out of your arteries to your liver, which removes it from your body.

Cholesterol itself isn’t bad. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and digestive fluids. Cholesterol also helps your organs function properly.

Yet having too much LDL cholesterol can be a problem. High cholesterol over time can damage your arteries, contribute to heart disease, and increase your risk for a stroke. Getting your cholesterol checked at regular doctor visits and lowering levels with diet, exercise, and medicines can help prevent these and other complications.

18/10/2017, 4:29 pm - Dinah: Our work is not to change what you do, but to witness what you do with enough awareness, enough curiosity, enough tenderness that the lies and old decisions upon which the compulsion is based become apparent and fall away. When you no longer believe that eating will save your life when you feel exhausted or overwhelmed or lonely, you will stop. When you believe in yourself more than you believe in food, you will stop using food as if it were your only chance at not falling apart. When the shape of your body no longer matches the shape of your beliefs, the weight disappears.

18/10/2017, 4:48 pm - Dinah: SAY NO TO DIRTY BOXERS TODAY

Contrary to popular belief, it is important to know how dirty underwear affects men's health. Failing to wear clean undergarments is not only deemed unacceptable in today's society, but can contribute to illness. Men considering wearing those skivvies for a few more days should probably think twice.
1. How Dirty Underwear Affects Men's Health...
Dirty underwear can and often is a breeding ground for all sorts of microbes. The groin area is a particularly warm and moist , this allows an environment for microorganisms to thrive and grow. Dirty underwear affects men's health using this mechanism because the individual is exposed to an even greater amount of bacteria. This can result in an embarrassing infection that could have been avoided. Men that are uncircumcised, don't wash the pubic region often or well, and those that already have an infection are even more at risk for a fungal or bacterial infection.
2. Contaminated Dirty underwear
can cause health concerns to more than just the groin area through direct contamination. Bacteria such as E. coli is considered norma flora, or normal bacteria that serves a purpose in the digestive system. However, when this particular bacteria is found in other areas of the body, illness can and does often occur. Dirty underwear affects men's health by exposing the individual to this strain of bacteria and others that can be potentially harmful outside of the digestive and urinary tract. Cross-contamination can easily occur while digging through the hamper for underwear and the majority of individuals do not wash hands after dressing.
Dirty underwear affects men's health in various ways. Those who fail to wear clean underwear may also be skimping on other forms of hygiene as well, making them more susceptible to illness in general.

18/10/2017, 9:22 pm - Ede: We can always move to slack, bigger better and professional
18/10/2017, 9:25 pm - Babajide Martins: Slack is annoying when it comes to bad network and reloading of messages...
18/10/2017, 9:25 pm - Babajide Martins: It's what I don't get when o WhatsApp
18/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Babajide Martins: The only thing it has its it's integration with email and drive account...even twitter, dribble and creative cloud... So yea... professional...
But for chat and all.. *WhatsApp*
18/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Babajide Martins: Slack interface can be quite daunting for newbies
18/10/2017, 9:29 pm - Ede: With time ud get use to it,..

18/10/2017, 9:29 pm - Babajide Martins: With time someone can get frustrated and uninstall the app
18/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Ede: But for this kind of platform, I believe slack should be better, we can even create different channels, for jokes, lectures, motivations and all
18/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Babajide Martins: I mean I just opened it now see that connecting stuff there....that alone pisses me off
18/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Babajide Martins: Which can get confusing
18/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Ede: Lol, same as twitter too, most newbies get lost using Twitter for the first tims
18/10/2017, 9:31 pm - Babajide Martins: Ok o
18/10/2017, 9:31 pm - Babajide Martins: But you must first do a tut on slack for them niggas here
18/10/2017, 9:32 pm - Ede: Nope, compartmentalising enhance flow of info, you don't get to skip many important messages because alot of jokes or argument messages

And now u want to complicate someone's life further with slack
18/10/2017, 10:22 pm - Babajide Martins: Slack can't even record for lectures 🤦🏿‍♂
18/10/2017, 10:25 pm - Tosin Lawal: !!!

18/10/2017, 10:35 pm - Tosin Lawal: Guy. Slack is still not the best option
18/10/2017, 10:36 pm - Karo: No it's not, but it's an option worth exploring as WhatsApp is also *not* the best option👌🏾
18/10/2017, 10:36 pm - Tosin Lawal: Lemme rephrase this
18/10/2017, 10:37 pm - Tosin Lawal: Slack is still not a better option
18/10/2017, 10:37 pm - Karo: You can't certify this
18/10/2017, 10:39 pm - Tosin Lawal: Hmm.. Chill
18/10/2017, 10:39 pm - Tosin Lawal: It might be
18/10/2017, 10:39 pm - Tosin Lawal: Just thought of something
18/10/2017, 10:39 pm - Karo: This shouldn't be a back and forth conversation.

I just put it out there, slack is an option worth exploring
18/10/2017, 10:40 pm - Karo: Oh
18/10/2017, 10:40 pm - Karo: Kindly share
18/10/2017, 10:44 pm - Tosin Lawal: The different channels parole for different fields of study

How you doing?
19/10/2017, 12:40 am - Babajide Martins: Still not good
19/10/2017, 2:20 am - Dbkoncept: Slack 😡
19/10/2017, 2:22 am - Dbkoncept: When Networking is balls in an IM, there's no marketing or feature hyping you can do. The IM is gonna be balls.
19/10/2017, 2:23 am - Dbkoncept: WhatsApp has enormous advantage than Slack can ever provide in it's life time.
19/10/2017, 2:24 am - Dbkoncept: Let me list 3 major ones that concerns consumers.
19/10/2017, 2:27 am - Dbkoncept: 1. It's gain the heart and continues to gain the heart of new users because it's install and start using no prolonged tutorials needed.

PS: _My Mum uses Status, she just signed up on WhatsApp early this year_
19/10/2017, 2:31 am - Dbkoncept: 2. Many mobile network and ISPs recognize it and create a separate and cheap connectivity package for it, even making the users more active and most of the times always active.

PS. _With 1MB remaining on your phone you can still send non media messages for the next 5-8min_
19/10/2017, 2:38 am - Dbkoncept: 3. WhatsApp has no major consumer end issues to be fixed, just large improvement queue and for a company that big, improvements come on demand, not just any how, (it's a branch of marketing); do what majority of your users want/need not just what you think might be okay. 

PS: _Be sure that all these  features you need so much are in the WhatsApp improvements queue, they are just stalling and always checking for the next pressing need of their end users, it will also be an addendum to know that WhatsApp for Business is coming real soon_
19/10/2017, 2:38 am - Dbkoncept: 🤞🏾
19/10/2017, 2:41 am - Babajide Martins: 👌🏿
19/10/2017, 7:34 am - Tosin Lawal: SayNOtoSlack
19/10/2017, 7:39 am - Karo: I only put slack out there as a better fit to the needs and purpose of this group - not the needs of the average consumer. WhatsApp is an infinitely better IM application, but it's not just for IM we are talking about here. The tight integration with Dropbox and other cloud services that slack has, among other features might be more geared to the needs of this group than WhatsApp... But still, I'm just putting it out there 🤞🏾 


_also, WhatsApp for business is not free😊_
19/10/2017, 7:41 am - Babajide Martins: Hey....I'm like no doubt..
I'm just worried about the ui
19/10/2017, 7:43 am - Chisom: The UI is fine
19/10/2017, 7:44 am - Chisom: But experience for someone that hasn't used slack before
19/10/2017, 7:44 am - Chisom: It'll take some time getting used to
19/10/2017, 7:47 am - Babajide Martins: I didn't say it's not fine!!!
I said it would be daunting go new users...some would stop using or delete app before they get frustrated.
19/10/2017, 7:50 am - Dbkoncept: UX
19/10/2017, 7:51 am - Dbkoncept: In other words SabiApp update is coming really soon
19/10/2017, 7:52 am - Babajide Martins: UI renders UX tiring and annoying
19/10/2017, 7:52 am - Babajide Martins: 👌🏿
19/10/2017, 8:03 am - Dbkoncept: *New:*
* Lecture/Course Notes bookmarking

* Lecture Notes readout loud
* Gist | Chat room = Each Course offered
* Reduced size from *21mb* to *5mb* ✨✨✨

21/10/2017, 8:21 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: For a developing nation which consumes goods and services as much as Nigeria does, 12.5% is quite alarming.

21/10/2017, 8:51 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: 3 forms of Social Entrepreneurship: For-Profit Enterprise, Non-profit Enterprise and Hybrid Models which is a combination of the aforementioned 2. But whatever a Social Entrepreneur does whether she makes profit or not, you must affect a positive social, cultural(people-based) and environmental development.

Say if you have a digital marketing company or a software company, the culture of the people relating to computer and internet use. How can your business improve their lives or their business? Can you help them know what other better ways they can make use of their computer or their phones or Facebook or instagram.

21/10/2017, 9:17 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: People want to be associated with others who are adding values. So their is a shift in customer's awareness about the impact of their purchase decisions. companies are realising that they need to be socially responsible or they will lose their customers. Star, the alcohol brand, organises the music talent show as a form of social responsibility since their product has no way of adding value. All alcohol consumers in the house, excuse me on that. Also Airtel Nigeria organises the Sunday show on helping lives or something(i dont think I got the title of that show correctly).

They want to sponsor and get involved with creative  causes, events and projects that reflect their their brands. Give them that and they give you their resource too!

So we need to get creative with our ideas and not limit our potentials. Don't forget that these are big companies. They are doing this as a form of marketing too. So think big! Don't be limited.

21/10/2017, 9:58 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: I hope we picked up a few things that can help us or even enlighten us, to say the least, on the matter of Social Entrepreneurship. In summary, Social Entrepreneurship is using a business as a platform to effect a positive social, cultural or environmental change, which is a lot of what Nigeria needs right now. Companies want to give back to their communities as a way of being socially responsible. We can harness this need they have, which cant be effectively met by their administration but by creative Social Entrepreneurs like you and I. We need to come up with helpful contents, ideas, technologies, causes and projects to meet and harness this social need, hence we can make impacts ourselves and maybe make money too! It was great having the honour to lecture us tonight. Thank you so much for your time

22/10/2017, 10:48 pm - Chika Nels: Evening, Members of the hub.  
Like I said earlier, *new arrangements* in line with the effectiveness and efficiency of the hub will be put in place for the *benefit of everyone*.
22/10/2017, 10:49 pm - Chika Nels: Based on my survey and feedbacks from most of us here; Every member of the hub is expected to *drop here, content related to his/her area of expertise at least one day weekly*. This contents could be in form of *links, bcs, pics, pdf/doc file, ppt, clips* etc. and can be as much as possible so long it's very relevant. 
This will ensure we don't even have to wait before some of us are voted to lecture before we learn from them. It would also help give more insight to what they have to offer as ensure effective nominations.
22/10/2017, 10:50 pm - Chika Nels: Do well to answer questions when asked about your things related to your area of expertise and don't hesitate to ask others too. 
This new arrangement would be a more solid criteria for knowing the active and inactive members of the hub compared alongside activeness(non-ghosting) in the hub. 
We begin tomorrow. Together we can make this hub a splendid hub for learning. Let's share knowledge, gain 10xce more and *make the hub a better one for learning*. 
Cheers!

23/10/2017, 11:46 am - Chika Nels: Oh, yeah.. I saw this ad. Comments have been positive and encouraging so far so it looks authentic. No harm in trying, *I hope they don't complement with ghost followers tho*. That's pretty too cheap to be true. I charge at the rate of #4 per follower, based on target customers depending on the brand/client, worst case #3 for special clients so I dunno. You may try it out if you wish to.

23/10/2017, 7:16 pm - Akolab: Genes 👀
23/10/2017, 7:30 pm - Dinah: 🎈Height is a polygenic character and not a single gene character..

🎈What we know about genes, is that there are two forms of a gene that you can have, dominant or recessive.
 For each gene, you inherit one form that came from your father and one that came from your mother.

 🎈Depending on the combination of those genes, they are expressed (phenotypical, meaning observable or measurable) or dormant in the child.

 It's extremely unlikely that you could say that either the father or the mother would typically be responsible for passing on the combination of genes responsible for height.

For example, two parents of, what most people would consider, normal height could pass on recessive genes for dwarfism. They both had a form of the gene that was not expressed in them because of the combinations of genes that they received from their parents.

Height may not be governed by a single gene, but may be the result of many different combination of genes. It's also influenced by nutrition and other environmental factors.

23/10/2017, 7:49 pm - Chika Nels: Lol.. But this is kinda outdated. Posted in 2012.
The fact above was a result of a research done on 1000 parents and newborns about a year ago or so. Although more experiments have to be conducted to verify that fact tho. But they released the conclusion based on their experiment. Some other calculations can also be done to give an estimated idea too. 
I like to verify responses to answers on Quora just to make sure. Had to confirm.

It utilizes an algorithm based on a combination of what Jomi mentioned. But then how does it streamline these posts because there could be several posts that fall under these categories? 
Activity! That is; how much activity the posts aggregates within a short time after posting. The algorithm selects the top most active posts within a short time out of the many and sends them up to explore.

24/10/2017, 1:22 pm - Chika Nels: A new study found a link between sleep duration and a measure of chromosomal health in sperm. The findings are published in the Journal of Sleep Research.

In the study of 2020 semen samples provided by 796 male volunteers from colleges in Chongqing (China) from 2013 to 2015, volunteers with more than nine hours per day of sleep and those with 6.5 hours or less per day sleep had 41 per cent and 30 per cent lower High DNA Stainability — an index that represents the proportion of sperm with abnormal chromatin — than did volunteers with seven to 7.5 hours per day of sleep. Chromatin is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes.

“This is new information after our previous finding that sleep duration has an inverse U-shaped association with semen volume and total sperm count. In the previous study, we found that these two semen parameters were highest when sleep is 7.0 to 7.5 hours per day, and either longer or shorter sleep was associated with the decrease of the two semen parameters,” said Dr. Jia Cao, co-author of the study.

25/10/2017, 9:14 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Solved as...

A - polygon
B - banana.
C - Clock.

A + A + A = 45.....eqn 1
B + B + A = 23.....eqn 2
B + C + C = 10.....eqn 3

Solving gives 
A - 15, B - 5, C - 3

Then 3+4+4 *15

25/10/2017, 9:16 pm - Chika Nels: Still attempt with a good explanation.
25/10/2017, 9:18 pm - Urenna: Let's say the first shape is 15!
15+15+15=45
23-15=8\2=4 
Which means a bunch of bananas is 4 
10-4=6\2=3
Therefore 
3+4+4×15=67
25/10/2017, 9:18 pm - ‪+234 808 497 7688‬: Must I show my working? My answer is 88.
25/10/2017, 9:18 pm - ‪+234 703 415 3440‬: The polygonal shapes are dimensioned. In the 1st example, Each has a total sides of *15 (6+5+4 = 15)*

Banana is 4.

The first 2 clocks each read 3 O'Clock.

In the last equation, we have:

(2"Oclock + 4 (banana) + 4 } x 11 (6 sides of a hexagon+ 5 sides of a pentagon)...

>> (2+4+4) x 11 

>> 10 x 11 = *110*

25/10/2017, 9:21 pm - Urenna: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
25/10/2017, 9:21 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Solved as...

A - polygon
B - banana.
C - Clock.

A + A + A = 45.....eqn 1
B + B + A = 23.....eqn 2
B + C + C = 10.....eqn 3

Solving gives 
A - 15, B - 5, C - 3

Then 3+4+4*15...by Bodmas, 67!
25/10/2017, 9:21 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If three of the polygon equals 45. Dividing 45 by 3 equals 15. That means a Polygon equals 15

If two banana and a polygon equals 23. Then deduct the polygon from 23 which gives 8, divide 8 into two since there are two banana left which gives 4. That means banana equals 4

Using the same rules, deduct banana from 10 which gives 6 and divide the Ans by 2 to get threell
25/10/2017, 9:22 pm - ‪+234 703 415 3440‬: Sorry, I did not have my glasses on...

Now, my FNAL anser is:

The polygonal shapes are dimensioned. In the 1st example, Each has a total sides of 15 (6+5+4 = 15)

Banana is 4.

The first 2 clocks each read 3 O'Clock.

In the last equation, we have:

(2"Oclock + 3 (banana) + 3 } x 11 (6 sides of a hexagon+ 5 sides of a pentagon)...

>> (2+3+3) x 11 

>> 8 x 11 = *88*

25/10/2017, 9:23 pm - ‪+234 808 497 7688‬: 15 + 15 + 15: 45

4+ 4 + 15: 23

4 + 3 + 3: 10

2 + 3 +3 * 11: 88
25/10/2017, 9:23 pm - Urenna: Let's say the first shape is 15!
15+15+15=45
23-15=8\2=4 
Which means a bunch of bananas is 4 
10-4=6\2=3
Therefore 
3+4+4×15=67

25/10/2017, 9:27 pm - Chika Nels: .
25/10/2017, 9:28 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Solved as...

A - polygon
B - banana.
C - Clock.

A + A + A = 45.....eqn 1
B + B + A = 23.....eqn 2
B + C + C = 10.....eqn 3

Solving Simultaneously gives 
A - 15, B - 5, C - 3

In simple terms...

If three of the polygon equal 45. Dividing 45 by 3 equals 15. That means a Polygon equals 15

If two banana and a polygon equals 23. Then deducting the polygon from 23 which gives 8, divide 8 into two since there are two banana left which gives 4. That means banana equals 4

By the same token, deduct banana from 10 which gives 6 and divide the Ans by 2 to get three.

Then 3+4+4*15...by Bodmas, 67!

25/10/2017, 9:29 pm - Urenna: Let's say the first shape is 15!
15+15+15=45
23-15=8\2=4 
Which means a bunch of bananas is 4 
10-4=6\2=3
Therefore 
2+4+4×15=66
25/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Urenna: Let's say the first shape is 15!
15+15+15=45

Therefore due to the change in the hands of time 3 becomes two:
2+4+4×15=66
25/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Solved as...

A - polygon
B - banana.
C - Clock.

A + A + A = 45.....eqn 1
B + B + A = 23.....eqn 2
B + C + C = 10.....eqn 3

Solving Simultaneously gives 
A - 15, B - 5, C - 3

In simple terms...

If three of the polygon equal 45. Dividing 45 by 3 equals 15. That means a Polygon equals 15

If two banana and a polygon equals 23. Then deducting the polygon from 23 which gives 8, divide 8 into two since there are two banana left which gives 4. That means banana equals 4

By the same token, deduct banana from 10 which gives 6 and divide the Ans by 2 to get three.

Then 3+4+4*15...by Bodmas, 67!


Finally!
25/10/2017, 9:30 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: 2+4+4=10

26/10/2017, 9:13 pm - Chika Nels: *🙌🏼
26/10/2017, 11:13 pm - Akolab: The phrase ' How was your night?' In the English language means, , ' How was last night's sex?'

Or, if for instance, we are close and you know I went home with a man or woman last night and you ask as an accomplice ' How was your night?' In this case it simply means, ' so did it go well or did it go as expected?'

I'll give you two real life examples. One was mine and one happened in my cousins office. She consults for the UN.

In my own case, I jog most mornings. Years back, having just returned to the country, this young man will greet me every morning and I'll answer. Then one day, he asked me, 'How was your night?' He went merrily on his way, I stopped, turned looking at him in anger fuming. My thoughts were, ' it's not your fault, if I hadn't been responding to your 'good morning' will we graduate to 'How was your night?'

Second occurrence, at my cousins office.

English woman comes in and everyone exchange the usual good morning. Then, one 'nice' Naija brother goes, 'How was your night?' English woman flares up ' How dare you!?'. ' How is my night your business?' Etc, it took major intervention to calm the woman down.

The answer to ' How was your night?' Is actually 'none of your business!'

I have checked our local languages, I am fluent in two, and passable in one. Even as transliteration, no Nigerian language asks 'How was your night?' I am checking because this phrase, for those who know, was not in use in Nigeria as recent as 7years ago. I suspect,some 'oversabi wannabe' heard it on a music video somewhere and wanted to form posh or as my Doctor friend said to me, it may have come from hospitals. It's common knowledge according to the doctor that sick people often have rough nights and most deaths to May occur at night. So a doctor's question to the patient during morning ward rounds is usually 'How was your night?' If we exported hospital vocabulary to the streets, are we now to assume, we are all at deaths door?

The proper address for mornings is simply 'good morning' and if you want to spice it up by being overtly friendly, you may add 'hope you slept well?' A person's night. Is not our business.

If we are Igbo it's either, ibolachi- have you woken up. Ututuoma- good morning.

If Yoruba, ekaro- good morning. You can go further as Yorubas are won't to do by adding ",se daada Leji' - hope you woke up well?

None of these our local greetings intrusively asks 'How was your night?' So, No! It is not African either.

So let us be well aware when we leave our lanes to go measuring that of others.....

Have u learnt something here?
Pls put it to use.

27/10/2017, 10:33 am - Ede: The Five Elements of the Developer Mindset

1. Learn to strap in and not stop until the job is done.

Anyone who has ever dabbled in coding knows that it is an exercise in patience. Sometimes, especially when you are getting started, you will spend HOURS trying to find one missing semi-colon or one miss-capitalized word that is breaking your script.

The good news is that computers are black and white: if it’s not right it won’t run.

The bad news is that computer are black and white: if it’s not right it won’t run.

The first tenet of the developer mindset is cultivating the zen of coding: you have to learn to be calm, break your problem into the smallest steps possible, and methodically go through your scripts line by line to root out the bug.

Most importantly, you can’t give up until it’s done.


2. Learn to love the pain. Or at least, not fight it.

Life in general, and coding in particular, is full of things that totally SUCK. But they are sucky things that we all have to deal with and work through and the best thing we can do for ourselves is to try our best to reframe how we think about.

And fortunately, the Eureka moment you get when it DOES all come together is worth all of it.

3. Remember WHY you are doing something!

Coding is like…being asked to write a book using only numbers. How would you do that?

Well…you could use 3 for e, 4 for a, 8 for b…

The point being that you are in this constant situation of having a limited set of tools to work with, and an ever changing set of things you are expected to accomplish.

The magic comes from you creatively figuring out how to bridge the gap between your limited toolkit and where you want to go.

A common trap for developers is to spend too much time focusing on HOW they do it. How clean their code is. How efficient. How fast.

And clean, efficient, fast code is a good thing. But only if it’s in the pursuit of something cool and useful.

The BEST developers come up with funny, clever, useful things to do with their technical skills.

Your challenge is to expertly use the coding tools at your disposal to make the MOST amazing, MOST useful thing you can think of.

Remember: code is the means, not the end unto itself.

4. Remind yourself that EVERYONE needs help. Reach out!

One of the biggest mistakes I see beginners make when it comes to programming is that they think they SHOULD know how to do it all and wait far too long before they reach out for help.

Stop that!

Look, of course, you do need to learn to be somewhat self-sufficient, but it’s well documented that just the process of asking a question can be enough to help you find the solution. So ask!

Moreover, ALL developers need help pretty much all of the time. And programmers have created a HUGE industry out of helping one another with various coding challenges. Stack Overflow, run by the parent company Stack Exchange, is worth, by some estimates, over $300 million!

Looking for help? Start by googling for the answer and you will no doubt find countless forums, blog posts, and StackOverflow threads explaining just how to fix your issue.

If not, start looking for IRC channels by topic. If you are a Ruby developer you can find one by just googling something like “Ruby channel on IRC” (#ruby-lang), or just search for the IRC channel of the topic of YOUR choice (Angular! Startups! Python!). Then download an IRC client and start chatting with other, like-minded devs!

If in-person is more your thing, take a look at Meetup for language- or topic-specific meetups, or google for something like “PHP user groups” in your area (replace PHP with the topic of your choice).

5. Keep in mind that having fun is key. Remember to be playful!

Programming is hard. And the best way to make hard things easier? Have a sense of humor!

For as long as humans have had computers, we have been using computers to make us laugh.



So get it with it already!

It's not applicable to African society
27/10/2017, 8:10 pm - Chijioke: There is no systematic oppression of women in African society. Simple!
27/10/2017, 8:11 pm - Chijioke: That's only existent in societies with White Supremacy, simply because of White male masculinity
27/10/2017, 8:11 pm - Chijioke: So leave their social conflict for them

27/10/2017, 8:21 pm - Chijioke: It's lack of meaning in cognition, concept and social construct simply means it's not an African Ideology
27/10/2017, 8:22 pm - Chijioke: *from an African perspective

27/10/2017, 8:51 pm - Chijioke: Explain this please?
27/10/2017, 8:51 pm - Kado: basically... my point being... it's about quality..not quantity.
27/10/2017, 8:52 pm - Chijioke: Lmao!
27/10/2017, 8:52 pm - Chijioke: Even a Nuke will not take out up to 100k people
27/10/2017, 8:52 pm - Chijioke: And there's no weapon larger
27/10/2017, 8:52 pm - Chijioke: And China has several nukes forget the bants that US has more
27/10/2017, 8:53 pm - Chijioke: That's a tale for another day
27/10/2017, 8:53 pm - Chijioke: A nation with 1.5 billion indigenes cannot have less of a critical weapon than one with 300 million non-indigenes
27/10/2017, 8:55 pm - Chijioke: Yes, his facts are hard and verifiable with the links he sometimes drops
27/10/2017, 8:55 pm - Kado: ever heard of God's particle?
27/10/2017, 8:55 pm - Chijioke: 😒
27/10/2017, 8:55 pm - Chijioke: We are not in a Sci-Fi movie please

27/10/2017, 8:56 pm - Chijioke: A nuclear bomb is the highest yielding material on the planet
27/10/2017, 8:56 pm - Kado: you probably do not realize how fast things are developing from the conceptual stage...
27/10/2017, 8:56 pm - Chijioke: Nah
27/10/2017, 8:56 pm - Kado: 🙄
27/10/2017, 8:56 pm - Chijioke: Actually it exists as antimatter
27/10/2017, 8:57 pm - Chijioke: But it's yield is falsified
27/10/2017, 8:57 pm - Kado: yeah, and when stressed under certain stressed conditions....could wipe away your planet...
27/10/2017, 8:58 pm - Kado: lol,  this happened because we weren't fit.
27/10/2017, 9:01 pm - Kado: if they'd left us... and nobody came over.... 
what would have been of Niger area?
27/10/2017, 9:02 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: The truth is office politics sucks, I would rather not be involved but what can a girl do... In this jungle we call life you either eat or you are eaten... It's up to you, who would you rather be? 😕
27/10/2017, 9:02 pm - Kado: they told you that?
27/10/2017, 9:02 pm - Chijioke: 😧
27/10/2017, 9:02 pm - Chijioke: What do you mean?
27/10/2017, 9:02 pm - Chijioke: We built the first ever institutions of learning
27/10/2017, 9:02 pm - Chijioke: We were headed somewhere
27/10/2017, 9:03 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Sorry about this... Wrong destination, please ignore
27/10/2017, 9:03 pm - Chijioke: We just weren't a waring people so developed no tangible weapons beyond those for hunting/fishing
27/10/2017, 9:04 pm - Chijioke: In fact the only warring people amongst us - The Ethiopians defeated Italian invaders in the first Italian-Ethiopian War
27/10/2017, 9:05 pm - Chijioke: And that's because prior to the invasion they had equally faced conflict with Arabs north of their land on what is today called Yemen and as such had developed more sophisticated weapons than others
27/10/2017, 9:05 pm - Chijioke: To say we were headed nowhere is wrong!
27/10/2017, 9:06 pm - Chijioke: A continent that built Pyramids and molded ancient artifacts
27/10/2017, 9:06 pm - Chijioke: That's vastly inaccurate
27/10/2017, 9:07 pm - Kado: headed somewhere...1. we built (majored in arts) ...moreover, the guys involved...they traveled to seek knowledge...2.we were parochial...religion taught them to have a limit in their thought process.
27/10/2017, 9:10 pm - Kado: with point no 2...there was no way these guys would head somewhere.... they had a limit.... and that's where they are now....
27/10/2017, 9:12 pm - Kado: between I was referring to Nigeria... Niger area... 
but it's still applicable to the convo
27/10/2017, 9:13 pm - Chijioke: I think you may know little about our history and tradition
27/10/2017, 9:13 pm - Chijioke: To say we were parochial
27/10/2017, 9:14 pm - Chijioke: Or to even attribute the origins of parochialism to Africa is misplaced
27/10/2017, 9:14 pm - Chijioke: Consider for a second that until 1800, Christianity was almost nonexistent on African soil
27/10/2017, 9:15 pm - Chijioke: Voodoo was more profound, eliminating our old gods was a necessary part of enslavement and colonialism
27/10/2017, 9:15 pm - Chijioke: How else do you rule over a people so foreign to you?
27/10/2017, 9:16 pm - Chijioke: 😧😧😧
27/10/2017, 9:16 pm - Kado: we were parochial when it comes to development... which is evident
27/10/2017, 9:16 pm - Chijioke: Only in modern day
27/10/2017, 9:16 pm - Chijioke: Which is not the subject of my initial statement
27/10/2017, 9:17 pm - Chijioke: And only came to be after destruction of our religion
27/10/2017, 9:17 pm - Chijioke: They launched campaigns to burn our places of worship
27/10/2017, 9:17 pm - Chijioke: This is well known
27/10/2017, 9:17 pm - Chijioke: Research it
27/10/2017, 9:18 pm - Chijioke: The whole point of tonight is simple
27/10/2017, 9:18 pm - Chijioke: Discern for yourself what is foreign and what isn't
27/10/2017, 9:19 pm - Chijioke: What is foreign has never worked and will never work
27/10/2017, 9:19 pm - Chijioke: We can try democracy from now till next year, it will never work!
27/10/2017, 9:19 pm - Kado: lol, we had no basis of our gods...we just worshipped because our fathers did... we couldn't argue about our gods...meaning it was relatively weaker...
27/10/2017, 9:19 pm - Chijioke: We need to do what's best for ourselves not what they tell us is best
27/10/2017, 9:20 pm - Chijioke: Good night
27/10/2017, 9:20 pm - Kado: something stronger had to come in
27/10/2017, 9:22 pm - Kado: and what isn't foreign has worked and will work?
27/10/2017, 9:23 pm - Chijioke: Maybe, Maybe not
27/10/2017, 9:23 pm - Chijioke: But one thing is for sure, for over a century we've tried foreign so it tine to switch up
27/10/2017, 9:23 pm - Chijioke: *it's time
27/10/2017, 9:24 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Can I ask you all to start rounding up?
27/10/2017, 9:25 pm - Kado: as far as I am concerned...even tho they had lured our fathers with mirrors to buy their ideology, it wouldn't have been sustainable to this date if it wasn't germane.
27/10/2017, 9:25 pm - Kado: doomsday abegggg
27/10/2017, 9:25 pm - Kado: so we should abandon our legal system too
27/10/2017, 9:25 pm - Chijioke: That was a lie to make us seem Foolish
27/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Chijioke: It was pure coercion
27/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Kado: be careful for what you wish for abegggg
27/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Chijioke: They forced Oba Dosunmu of Lagos, to give up Lagos under threat of force in 1911
27/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Chijioke: Of fucking course!
27/10/2017, 9:26 pm - Chijioke: I'm done arguing with you
27/10/2017, 9:27 pm - Chijioke: Read up some more
27/10/2017, 9:27 pm - Kado: clearly you are acquainted with the history
27/10/2017, 9:27 pm - Kado: but you seem misguided
27/10/2017, 9:28 pm - Kado: yes sir.
27/10/2017, 9:28 pm - Chijioke: For you to believe bed time tales of "mirror" being given to our ancestors
27/10/2017, 9:28 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Time up... 9:30 guys. We've allowed this and have enjoyed it too.
27/10/2017, 9:28 pm - Akanni Hafeez: 9:30.
27/10/2017, 9:29 pm - Chijioke: Guy it was by fire by force

27/10/2017, 9:29 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Go to DM anything from 9:30 forward!
27/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Kado: ewoooooooooo, 
we aren't matured for that in all candor... 
maybe in the year 5050...
come back with this idea... 
and I'd consider absorbing it
27/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Chijioke: Otherwise they wouldn't have drowned themselves occasionally in the ocean
27/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Thanx guys
27/10/2017, 9:30 pm - Akanni Hafeez: I guess this is all we can allow.
27/10/2017, 9:31 pm - Kado: well, I really can't ascertain on that... 
but all I know is that it was a conflate of luring and indirect force
27/10/2017, 9:32 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Thnx guys.

27/10/2017, 9:33 pm - Akanni Hafeez: So tomorrow... Our able lecturer will thrill us to something beautiful I believe.
27/10/2017, 9:33 pm - Kado: your fathers were so smart then....for the white to use force.. as that's the only option available for them....

That's one of the essence of the hub; occasional intellectual discuss👌🏼
27/10/2017, 9:43 pm - Kado: I'll do this...

He eventually won the case, the high court said that he'll be given 40m for damages as well as some other benefits.
28/10/2017, 12:55 pm - Akanni Hafeez: The state govt lawyers say they'd still look into the case.
28/10/2017, 12:55 pm - Akanni Hafeez: 😏

28/10/2017, 1:03 pm - Chika Nels: He couldn't even afford what ever they would sue him for... So they didn't really push in that line. They just made sure that he couldn't get any shows, receive air plays from any radio station, realease any track to the music market etc
28/10/2017, 1:04 pm - Akanni Hafeez: It's called brymoparalysis!

Someone pointed out on the BBC News that the Malaysian plane was hit not by a 'rocket' but by a 'missile'. From the dictionary definitions I have looked up I cannot tell the difference.

Missile An object which is forcibly propelled at a target, either by hand or from a mechanical weapon.

Rocket a cylindrical projectile that can be propelled to a great height or distance by the combustion of its contents...

30/10/2017, 11:45 am - Akolab: Good morning fellow Hub members. 
Just want to remind us; Every member of the hub is expected to drop here, content related to his/her area of expertise at least one day weekly. This contents could be in form of links, bcs, pics, pdf/doc file, ppt, clips etc. and can be as much as possible so long it's very relevant. 
This will ensure we don't even have to wait before some of us are voted to lecture before we learn from them. It would also help give more insight to what they have to offer as ensure effective nominations.

Do well to answer questions when asked about your things related to your area of expertise and don't hesitate to ask others too. 
This new arrangement would be a more solid criteria for knowing the active and inactive members of the hub compared alongside activeness(non-ghosting) in the hub. 
Together we can make this hub a splendid hub for learning. Let's share knowledge, gain 10xce more and make the hub a better one for learning. 
Cheers!

He is someone who became your uncle as a result of one of your parent marrying someone else.

They are related, not by 'Blood'
But by a legal procedure.
  Therefore, They can go ahead.

31/10/2017, 3:47 pm - Kado: https://www.google.com.ng/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2017-10-26/record-wind-will-force-germany-to-pay-power-users-this-weekend


*Germany Set To Pay Customers For Electricity Usage As Renewable Energy Generation Creates Huge Power Surplus*


German power producers are poised  _to pay customers to use electricity this weekend_. 

Wind generation is forecast to climb to a record on Sunday, creating more output than needed and driving electricity prices below zero, broker data compiled by Bloomberg show. It would be the first time this year that the average price for a whole day is negative, not just for specific hours.

Germany’s grid operators can struggle to keep the balance between how much energy people are using and how much is being produced when there are high amounts of wind generation. Negative prices mean that producers must either shut down power stations to reduce supply *_or pay consumers to take the electricity off the grid._*


Wind output is forecast to peak at 39,190 megawatts at 7 am on Sunday, equivalent to the output of about 40 nuclear reactors and enough to meet more than half of Germany’s total demand. Onshore wind turbines accounted for almost a third of Germany’s installed power capacity at the end of June and the nation is poised to increase new installations by 9 percent this year, according to industry federation BWE.

Wind power currently supplies about 10 percent of Europe’s electricity and is expected to continue to grow as the technology becomes cheaper. The cost of electricity from offshore wind farms, once one of the most expensive forms of green energy, is expected to slide by 71 percent over the next two decades, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. 

Earlier this year, Germany shocked the renewable energy industry by handing out contracts to developers willing to build offshore farms without subsidy.

*German wind generation reached a record 38,370 megawatts on 18 March.*

Just want to remind us; Every member of the hub is expected to *drop here, content related to his/her area of expertise at least one day weekly*. This contents could be in form of *links, bcs, pics, pdf/doc file, ppt, clips* etc. and can be as much as possible so long it's very relevant. 
This will ensure we don't even have to wait before some of us are voted to lecture before we learn from them. It would also help give more insight to what they have to offer as ensure effective nominations.

Do well to answer questions when asked about your things related to your area of expertise and don't hesitate to ask others too. 
This new arrangement would be a more solid criteria for knowing the active and inactive members of the hub compared alongside activeness(non-ghosting) in the hub. 
Together we can make this hub a splendid hub for learning. Let's share knowledge, gain 10xce more and *make the hub a better one for learning*. 
Cheers!

Tittled: *Sleeping In Can Be Too Much Of A Good Thing*

*Introduction*
      Work was brutal this week, and as a result you got less than five hours of sleep every night. Finally, the weekend is here and you're ready to earn those lost hours back with luxurious, back-to-back nights of 10-hour sleeping marathons. Well, science is here to tell you to reconsider that plan. Not only will you probably feel more tired, that extra sleep could also take a toll on your health.

*There's Such A Thing As Too Much Sleep*
     We all know there are risks associated with getting too little sleep. Chronic lack of sleep is linked to a higher risk of obesity, heart disease, depression, and even early death. Well, it turns out, chronic oversleeping carries the same risks. 

In 2016, a study in the International Journal of Cardiology delved into the sleep habits of nearly 400,000 Taiwanese adults over seven years. It found that when compared to people who slept six to eight hours per night, those who slept less than four hours per night experienced an increase of dying from heart disease of 34 percent. Those who slept more than eight hours per night? Nearly identical—their risk increased by 35 percent. Likewise, a 2015 study in Neurology found that people who slept more than eight hours a night experienced a higher risk of stroke, and a 2009 study in Sleep Medicine found the same thing for type II diabetes risk.
        But hold on, you might say. These are just correlations—what if it's a person's lousy health that leads to oversleeping, and not the other way around? Excellent point. That's why in 2014, a team of researchers studied the genetics behind these sleep-based health effects with nearly 900 pairs of twins for a study published in the journal Sleep. By using statistical models that examined genetic interactions, they were able to figure out how much a health issue like depression was influenced by genetics—that is, how much it was inherited and how much it was due to a person's environment—and whether sleep had an effect on that heritability. They found that while depressive symptoms had a heritability of about 27 percent in people who got around seven to nine hours of sleep per night, for those who got less than seven or more than nine, the heritability hovered around 50 percent. That's right: under- and oversleeping actually messes with your DNA. 

*How Much Sleep Is The Right Amount*?
      How much sleep is too much (or too little) depends on a number of factors, particularly your age. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get somewhere in the ballpark of seven to nine hours of sleep per night, though some can get away with as little as six or as much as 10. Generally, if you're waking up feeling well rested without nagging headaches, back pain, or grogginess, you're probably fine. If you think you might not be sleeping the right amount, however, it's important to try your best to get to bed on time—and get out of bed on time, too.

01/11/2017, 3:42 pm - ‪+233 24 176 9863‬: In 2010 I was a senior manager in a nice firm, my future was bright in the company and I was highly recommended for head of my department. There was a rising star as well, his name is Jacob. I tutored him and tried to manage his excesses because he was exceptionally brilliant. But, he was lazy and carefree. Hardly would he take corrections and rarely would he apologise.

My other colleagues wondered what I saw in him, but they weren’t working directly with him. I knew his type: he hated structure and would never last under a corporate environment. Still, he was a brilliant strategist. I handled him well and our results together with others on my team was highly commendable.

There came a time I was having marital issues and for this reason, I had little patience with Jacob and his shenanigans. I was short-tempered with him but he had gotten used to me managing his excesses, he didn’t take my anger seriously. In two weeks, I had given him 3 queries. This meant dismissal and when I was asked by HR if I truly wanted to let him go, I could not care less. I had my own problems and was not in the mood to babysit anyone.

Three years later, I lost my job because the company was downsizing and top management was affected. I foolishly assumed I would get a job anywhere so initially, I wasn’t worried. But 12 months in, I was still searching and my savings was dwindling fast. I decided, since I wasn’t getting any job, I’d drive my SUV as a cab to those commuting from the airport. This was better than waiting around for nothing…

 

The cab job surprisingly was not doing badly as I was picking up and dropping off esteemed clients. It wasn’t a lot of money but it was steady.

In July 2016, an esteemed client asked me to pick up his friend from the airport because his driver had flaked on him. This person I was to pick up would turn out to be Jacob. When he called to confirm his location, I instantly recognised his voice. My heart plunged but I wasn’t going to reject the job and disappoint a long-term client. Jacob exited the airport with only a hand luggage so there was no need for me to alight from the car. As he got in the car, I looked back from the driver’s seat to greet him but he was distracted on the phone and never looked up to notice me. He only answered my greeting and asked me to get going

As I drove him all the way to a hotel on the Island, I had tears in my eyes. He looked like he was doing well, his conversations on the phone also showed that he was in control. Jacob had done well for himself and I was now driving him. Life is tricky and has a way of making you the butt of its joke. I cannot lie that I was ashamed but I would never forgive myself if I let him go without letting him know I was proud of him.

We got to the hotel and I quickly got down from the car to open his door. This was when he noticed me. He was speechless for a while then he said in Yoruba “Oga you have been the one driving me since?” He was shocked at first but then he hugged me tight. The tears finally poured, I can’t really say what I felt but I know I didn’t expect his reaction.

 

“I heard you were let go, I sent you a message on my other number to find out how you were but you never responded”He said while still holding on to my shoulders

I remember receiving a message from him but he was one out of many that called or texted to pity me. I didn’t want anyone’s pity so I never responded.

Jacob made me park my car and took me in to his room to talk. He immediately told me about his new gig. After he was laid off, he got a consultation deal with a multinational which opened doors for him in other multinationals. Now, he has 15 people working for him but he was in desperate need of someone who does the same as him and he didn’t have to worry about their competence. He just wanted to focus more on bringing business to the company.

My life changed that day. I resumed work with Jacob in one week and I have made sure since then to treat his company as if it were mine.

 

I don’t know why he treated me so nicely after what I did to him but as men, we have never talked about it. I am sure though, that he can feel my gratitude in the way I work and my zeal in doing all I can to make sure he doesn’t have to worry about the back-end.

I hope someone learns from this. lf the world turns upside down, you may end up cleaning for your cleaner. Please always remember this when you act without consideration of the other person’s future.

A mysterious new technology emerges, seemingly out of nowhere, but actually the result of two decades of intense research and development by nearly anonymous researchers.

Political idealists project visions of liberation and revolution onto it; establishment elites heap contempt and scorn on it.

On the other hand, technologists – nerds – are transfixed by it. They see within it enormous potential and spend their nights and weekends tinkering with it

Eventually mainstream products, companies and industries emerge to commercialize it; its effects become profound; and later, many people wonder why its powerful promise wasn’t more obvious from the start.

What technology am I talking about? Personal computers in 1975, the Internet in 1993, and – I believe – Bitcoin in 2014.

One can hardly accuse Bitcoin of being an uncovered topic, yet the gulf between what the press and many regular people believe Bitcoin is, and what a growing critical mass of technologists believe Bitcoin is, remains enormous. In this post, I will explain why Bitcoin has so many Silicon Valley programmers and entrepreneurs all lathered up, and what I think Bitcoin’s future potential is.

First, Bitcoin at its most fundamental level is a breakthrough in computer science – one that builds on 20 years of research into cryptographic currency, and 40 years of research in cryptography, by thousands of researchers around the world.

Bitcoin is the first practical solution to a longstanding problem in computer science called the Byzantine Generals Problem. To quote from the original paper defining the B.G.P.: “[Imagine] a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.”

More generally, the B.G.P. poses the question of how to establish trust between otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet.
The practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.

What kinds of digital property might be transferred in this way? Think about digital signatures, digital contracts, digital keys (to physical locks, or to online lockers), digital ownership of physical assets such as cars and houses, digital stocks and bonds … and digital money.

All these are exchanged through a distributed network of trust that does not require or rely upon a central intermediary like a bank or broker. And all in a way where only the owner of an asset can send it, only the intended recipient can receive it, the asset can only exist in one place at a time, and everyone can validate transactions and ownership of all assets anytime they want.

How does this work?

Bitcoin is an Internet-wide distributed ledger. You buy into the ledger by purchasing one of a fixed number of slots, either with cash or by selling a product and service for Bitcoin. You sell out of the ledger by trading your Bitcoin to someone else who wants to buy into the ledger. Anyone in the world can buy into or sell out of the ledger any time they want – with no approval needed, and with no or very low fees. The Bitcoin “coins” themselves are simply slots in the ledger, analogous in some ways to seats on a stock exchange, except much more broadly applicable to real world transactions.

The Bitcoin ledger is a new kind of payment system. Anyone in the world can pay anyone else in the world any amount of value of Bitcoin by simply transferring ownership of the corresponding slot in the ledger. Put value in, transfer it, the recipient gets value out, no authorization required, and in many cases, no fees.

That last part is enormously important. Bitcoin is the first Internetwide payment system where transactions either happen with no fees or very low fees (down to fractions of pennies). Existing payment systems charge fees of about 2 to 3 percent – and that’s in the developed world. In lots of other places, there either are no modern payment systems or the rates are significantly higher. We’ll come back to that.

Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument. It is a way to exchange money or assets between parties with no pre-existing trust: A string of numbers is sent over email or text message in the simplest case. The sender doesn’t need to know or trust the receiver or vice versa. Related, there are no chargebacks – this is the part that is literally like cash – if you have the money or the asset, you can pay with it; if you don’t, you can’t. This is brand new. This has never existed in digital form before.

Bitcoin is a digital currency, whose value is based directly on two things: use of the payment system today – volume and velocity of payments running through the ledger – and speculation on future use of the payment system. This is one part that is confusing people. It’s not as much that the Bitcoin currency has some arbitrary value and then people are trading with it; it’s more that people can trade with Bitcoin (anywhere, everywhere, with no fraud and no or very low fees) and as a result it has value.

It is perhaps true right at this moment that the value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than actual payment volume, but it is equally true that that speculation is establishing a sufficiently high price for the currency that payments have become practically possible. The Bitcoin currency had to be worth something before it could bear any amount of real-world payment volume. This is the classic “chicken and egg” problem with new technology: new technology is not worth much until it’s worth a lot. And so the fact that Bitcoin has risen in value in part because of speculation is making the reality of its usefulness arrive much faster than it would have otherwise.

Critics of Bitcoin point to limited usage by ordinary consumers and merchants, but that same criticism was leveled against PCs and the Internet at the same stage. Every day, more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling Bitcoin, all around the world. The overall numbers are still small, but they are growing quickly. And ease of use for all participants is rapidly increasing as Bitcoin tools and technologies are improved. Remember, it used to be technically challenging to even get on the Internet. Now it’s not.

The criticism that merchants will not accept Bitcoin because of its volatility is also incorrect. Bitcoin can be used entirely as a payment system; merchants do not need to hold any Bitcoin currency or be exposed to Bitcoin volatility at any time. Any consumer or merchant can trade in and out of Bitcoin and other currencies any time they want.

Why would any merchant – online or in the real world – want to accept Bitcoin as payment, given the currently small number of consumers who want to pay with it? My partner Chris Dixon recently gave this example:

“Let’s say you sell electronics online. Profit margins in those businesses are usually under 5 percent, which means conventional 2.5 percent payment fees consume half the margin. That’s money that could be reinvested in the business, passed back to consumers or taxed by the government. Of all of those choices, handing 2.5 percent to banks to move bits around the Internet is the worst possible choice. Another challenge merchants have with payments is accepting international payments. If you are wondering why your favorite product or service isn’t available in your country, the answer is often payments.”
In addition, merchants are highly attracted to Bitcoin because it eliminates the risk of credit card fraud. This is the form of fraud that motivates so many criminals to put so much work into stealing personal customer information and credit card numbers.

Since Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument, the receiver of a payment does not get any information from the sender that can be used to steal money from the sender in the future, either by that merchant or by a criminal who steals that information from the merchant.

Credit card fraud is such a big deal for merchants, credit card processors and banks that online fraud detection systems are hair-trigger wired to stop transactions that look even slightly suspicious, whether or not they are actually fraudulent. As a result, many online merchants are forced to turn away 5 to 10 percent of incoming orders that they could take without fear if the customers were paying with Bitcoin, where such fraud would not be possible. Since these are orders that were coming in already, they are inherently the highest margin orders a merchant can get, and so being able to take them will drastically increase many merchants’ profit margins.

Bitcoin’s antifraud properties even extend into the physical world of retail stores and shoppers.

For example, with Bitcoin, the huge hack that recently stole 70 million consumers’ credit card information from the Target department store chain would not have been possible. Here’s how that would work:

You fill your cart and go to the checkout station like you do now. But instead of handing over your credit card to pay, you pull out your smartphone and take a snapshot of a QR code displayed by the cash register. The QR code contains all the information required for you to send Bitcoin to Target, including the amount. You click “Confirm” on your phone and the transaction is done (including converting dollars from your account into Bitcoin, if you did not own any Bitcoin).

Target is happy because it has the money in the form of Bitcoin, which it can immediately turn into dollars if it wants, and it paid no or very low payment processing fees; you are happy because there is no way for hackers to steal any of your personal information; and organized crime is unhappy. (Well, maybe criminals are still happy: They can try to steal money directly from poorly-secured merchant computer systems. But even if they succeed, consumers bear no risk of loss, fraud or identity theft.)

Finally, I’d like to address the claim made by some critics that Bitcoin is a haven for bad behavior, for criminals and terrorists to transfer money anonymously with impunity. This is a myth, fostered mostly by sensationalistic press coverage and an incomplete understanding of the technology. Much like email, which is quite traceable, Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous. Further, every transaction in the Bitcoin network is tracked and logged forever in the Bitcoin blockchain, or permanent record, available for all to see. As a result, Bitcoin is considerably easier for law enforcement to trace than cash, gold or diamonds.

What’s the future of Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop. The more people who use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin is for everyone who uses it, and the higher the incentive for the next user to start using the technology. Bitcoin shares this network effect property with the telephone system, the web, and popular Internet services like eBay and Facebook.

In fact, Bitcoin is a four-sided network effect. There are four constituencies that participate in expanding the value of Bitcoin as a consequence of their own self-interested participation. Those constituencies are (1) consumers who pay with Bitcoin, (2) merchants who accept Bitcoin, (3) “miners” who run the computers that process and validate all the transactions and enable the distributed trust network to exist, and (4) developers and entrepreneurs who are building new products and services with and on top of Bitcoin.

All four sides of the network effect are playing a valuable part in expanding the value of the overall system, but the fourth is particularly important.

All over Silicon Valley and around the world, many thousands of programmers are using Bitcoin as a building block for a kaleidoscope of new product and service ideas that were not possible before. And at our venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, we are seeing a rapidly increasing number of outstanding entrepreneurs – not a few with highly respected track records in the financial industry – building companies on top of Bitcoin.

For this reason alone, new challengers to Bitcoin face a hard uphill battle. If something is to displace Bitcoin now, it will have to have sizable improvements and it will have to happen quickly. Otherwise, this network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance.

One immediately obvious and enormous area for Bitcoin-based innovation is international remittance. Every day, hundreds of millions of low-income people go to work in hard jobs in foreign countries to make money to send back to their families in their home countries – over $400 billion in total annually, according to the World Bank. Every day, banks and payment companies extract mind-boggling fees, up to 10 percent and sometimes even higher, to send this money.





Switching to Bitcoin, which charges no or very low fees, for these remittance payments will therefore raise the quality of life of migrant workers and their families significantly. In fact, it is hard to think of any one thing that would have a faster and more positive effect on so many people in the world’s poorest countries.

Moreover, Bitcoin generally can be a powerful force to bring a much larger number of people around the world into the modern economic system. Only about 20 countries around the world have what we would consider to be fully modern banking and payment systems; the other roughly 175 have a long way to go. As a result, many people in many countries are excluded from products and services that we in the West take for granted. Even Netflix, a completely virtual service, is only available in about 40 countries. Bitcoin, as a global payment system anyone can use from anywhere at any time, can be a powerful catalyst to extend the benefits of the modern economic system to virtually everyone on the planet.

And even here in the United States, a long-recognized problem is the extremely high fees that the “unbanked” — people without conventional bank accounts – pay for even basic financial services. Bitcoin can be used to go straight at that problem, by making it easy to offer extremely low-fee services to people outside of the traditional financial system.

A third fascinating use case for Bitcoin is micropayments, or ultrasmall payments. Micropayments have never been feasible, despite 20 years of attempts, because it is not cost effective to run small payments (think $1 and below, down to pennies or fractions of a penny) through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structure of those systems makes that nonviable.

All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, that’s trivially easy. Bitcoins have the nifty property of infinite divisibility: currently down to eight decimal places after the dot, but more in the future. So you can specify an arbitrarily small amount of money, like a thousandth of a penny, and send it to anyone in the world for free or near-free.

Think about content monetization, for example. One reason media businesses such as newspapers struggle to charge for content is because they need to charge either all (pay the entire subscription fee for all the content) or nothing (which then results in all those terrible banner ads everywhere on the web). All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, there is an economically viable way to charge arbitrarily small amounts of money per article, or per section, or per hour, or per video play, or per archive access, or per news alert.

Another potential use of Bitcoin micropayments is to fight spam. Future email systems and social networks could refuse to accept incoming messages unless they were accompanied with tiny amounts of Bitcoin – tiny enough to not matter to the sender, but large enough to deter spammers, who today can send uncounted billions of spam messages for free with impunity.

Finally, a fourth interesting use case is public payments. This idea first came to my attention in a news article a few months ago. A random spectator at a televised sports event held up a placard with a QR code and the text “Send me Bitcoin!” He received $25,000 in Bitcoin in the first 24 hours, all from people he had never met. This was the first time in history that you could see someone holding up a sign, in person or on TV or in a photo, and then send them money with two clicks on your smartphone: take the photo of the QR code on the sign, and click to send the money.

Think about the implications for protest movements. Today protesters want to get on TV so people learn about their cause. Tomorrow they’ll want to get on TV because that’s how they’ll raise money, by literally holding up signs that let people anywhere in the world who sympathize with them send them money on the spot. Bitcoin is a financial technology dream come true for even the most hardened anticapitalist political organizer.

The coming years will be a period of great drama and excitement revolving around this new technology.

For example, some prominent economists are deeply skeptical of Bitcoin, even though Ben S. Bernanke, formerly Federal Reserve chairman, recently wrote that digital currencies like Bitcoin “may hold long-term promise, particularly if they promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” And in 1999, the legendary economist Milton Friedman said: “One thing that’s missing but will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A – the way I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you, and you may get that without knowing who I am.”

Economists who attack Bitcoin today might be correct, but I’m with Ben and Milton.

Further, there is no shortage of regulatory topics and issues that will have to be addressed, since almost no country’s regulatory framework for banking and payments anticipated a technology like Bitcoin.


But I hope that I have given you a sense of the enormous promise of Bitcoin. Far from a mere libertarian fairy tale or a simple Silicon Valley exercise in hype, Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals and businesses alike.

Hence, it's not affected by any country's Monetary Policy Rate or Fed Rate which on the positive side makes it free of fluctuations caused through policy and controlled economic situations and on the negative side may not be able to withstand long run shocks in global market due to exogenous financial variables and interplay of the forces of its demand and supply

Before 1930, the world monetary base was *gold* which was considered the most stable commodity in the market (Hence, a rush by world powers to acquire gold reserves and also exploit Africa for gold). But as more countries are acquiring gold as reserves and there was hardly no regulations on exploitations gold, there was a need for shift in the monetary base and also a means of regulating this monetary base.

Then America being one of the affected countries due to the downturn play in investment due to investors perception that the US may divest gold. They came up with the Bretton Woods institution (World Bank, IMF etc)

01/11/2017, 10:28 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Xi Jinping of China, Putin of Russia, and other world competitors started looking for alternatives. The Chinese saw the greenlight first and they helped the world out of recession thereby shifting the gaze of world economic power from US to China
01/11/2017, 10:31 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: US needed to create a new alternative so the 4th Industrial Revolution Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning influence emerged as they started developing new currencies to be known as crytocurrency guided by the Classical school of monetary thought
01/11/2017, 10:32 pm - Mosad: 🤔
01/11/2017, 10:32 pm - Dinah: Interesting
01/11/2017, 10:33 pm - Mosad: School of monetary thought.  Which is?
01/11/2017, 10:34 pm - Chika Nels: I just have to observe great men talk and learn😊
01/11/2017, 10:35 pm - ‪+234 813 866 1756‬: 😊
01/11/2017, 10:35 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Listening @2348168176267 ...
01/11/2017, 10:35 pm - Mosad: If u say Us had to start developing Cryptos as alternatives...  Why then was it not widely accepted?  Why was it something common to the dark and deep Web?
01/11/2017, 10:36 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Politics and it's effect:
There was going to be a change in the government of United States and there was a speculation that the dollars will crash (note: election periods always put much pressure on the domestic currencies as so much is spent and investors don't always want to lose money so they always look for alternatives way of keeping their money safe)
While sourcing for alternatives, cryptocurrencies became so seductive because of its benefits and safety so investors started using cryptocurrencies. You'll notice that all these cryptocurrencies became very popular during the heat of US election
01/11/2017, 10:36 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I need you to drive home your thoughts sir...so we can continue from there 😊
01/11/2017, 10:36 pm - ‪+234 813 866 1756‬: True...
01/11/2017, 10:37 pm - Mosad: 😉
01/11/2017, 10:38 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: @2348168176267 what really is your point sir?
01/11/2017, 10:45 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Then, the world competitors saw that as alternatives. China saw an alternative so it was very surprising to see a very strict controlled economy open its borders to BitCoin which was said to be a liberal currency.
01/11/2017, 10:45 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Note that Bitcoin began as an experiment in economics and politics, as a project to create electronic money that anyone could use but no one controlled, especially a sovereign authority. The code behind the new currency gave life to libertarian ideals like: money free from government controls on spending and taxation; transactions that could ignore a global, sometimes corrupt banking system; and freedom from central bank targeting of interest rates and inflation. It was also rebuke to the very notion of conventional money.
01/11/2017, 10:46 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: *you will also confirm that China has the biggest share of the cryptocurrency world*

Most BitCoin countries are Chinese and the Chinese government somewhat has a control over it
01/11/2017, 10:47 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The September 4 crackdown on BitCoin in China via regulatory measures had effect on BitCoin across the globe
01/11/2017, 10:48 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: *Hence, China achieved a new way to control the global economy which cannot be broken in time*
01/11/2017, 10:49 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Now that I have explored a little bit of political economics, I will explain some of my fears about the long run feasibility of BitCoin
01/11/2017, 10:54 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: ******


If China has the highest number of BitCoin companies and the RMB (Chinese currency) is very popular in BitCoin, don't you think that any shock from the Chinese economy would affect BitCoin?

Also, won't regulatory measures of China (a centrally planned economy) affect the value of BitCoin?

What if most BitCoin companies domiciled in China were forced to close by their government just like the September 4 crackdown. What will happen in the Bitcoin market?

What if in the long run, there's more demand than supply, won't there be a crisis
01/11/2017, 10:55 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: There are so many questions concerning the BitCoin but I will advise that even if you want to engage in BitCoin transactions, kindly do Short Term investment and Cash out
01/11/2017, 10:56 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Just like every other monetary base, it's not a long term pegged currency and is very volatile compared to real term investment
01/11/2017, 11:02 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I hope I can go on and on but time and battery won't permit.
I hope I was able to clarify some things @2348167141023

01/11/2017, 11:20 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Now there were reasons why it seems as though bitcoin was crashing in September
01/11/2017, 11:20 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: It wasn't crashing by the way
01/11/2017, 11:21 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: How does control a large portion of the market in the Bitcoin/crypto community

01/11/2017, 11:21 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: They only own mining pools
01/11/2017, 11:22 pm - Chika Nels: Lol... You have to step up your campaign game. If you really need some one to lecture so bad, play your politics outside the hub.
Just thought I should chip in that advice😁😎
01/11/2017, 11:22 pm - Tosin Lawal: You should probably introduce debates formally as something the hub organises @2349031571213
01/11/2017, 11:22 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Basically because the policy and environment is favorable for mining
01/11/2017, 11:23 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Japan to a large extent even has more adoptors than China
01/11/2017, 11:23 pm - Chika Nels: Yeah bro, I should. Nice one, Thanks👌🏼👍🏼
01/11/2017, 11:23 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I will use the last bit of my battery to say this 

Have you heard about *"the bull and bear"* in investment?

Do you know there are some investors that are waiting for a slide or loss before investing
01/11/2017, 11:24 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Bitmain has one of the largest pools in China yet only few of his workers own a unit of bitcoin
01/11/2017, 11:24 pm - Urenna: Yes!!!! Nice one but  If it's not entertainment, language, food and nutrition or Behaviorism! Count me out 🏃🏃🏃🏃
01/11/2017, 11:24 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Didn't the price of BitCoin crash after the Chinese crackdown in September?
01/11/2017, 11:24 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: That's normal market psychology
01/11/2017, 11:24 pm - Dinah: I see now
Very clearly👀
01/11/2017, 11:24 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Buy low sell high
01/11/2017, 11:24 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: It's a common rule
01/11/2017, 11:25 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: It's not market psychology, it basically a norm in investment
01/11/2017, 11:25 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Lol...I smile when I hear stuff like this 😊
01/11/2017, 11:25 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: In speculative investment, things like this happen very often

01/11/2017, 11:25 pm - Chika Nels: 😉
01/11/2017, 11:25 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: It's always pretty difficult to have your view completely passed across
01/11/2017, 11:26 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Same thing
01/11/2017, 11:27 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I'm not trying to force my view or trying to discourage anyone from engaging in BitCoin transactions *but I am saying Beware of this new way of Economic control*
01/11/2017, 11:27 pm - Dinah: So sad

01/11/2017, 11:32 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Mathematics and computer coming into play
01/11/2017, 11:32 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: But also, I am warning against the antics of the Asian Tigers and their thirst for power
01/11/2017, 11:33 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: That's the beauty sir
01/11/2017, 11:33 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Blockchain technology the underlying factor

01/11/2017, 11:35 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If you think so, it's your line of career or business and I wish you best of luck

But I will like if it's truly decentralised and free from the influence of government regulations
01/11/2017, 11:35 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Lol 😅
01/11/2017, 11:36 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Education and information is what we actually do need 😊
01/11/2017, 11:36 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I want you to understand that we are not in *a free capitalist system* that's immune of government influences.

So if you think the government doesn't have an influence, think twice and remember the Chinese crackdown in China and what happened to people's investment in September 4
01/11/2017, 11:37 pm - Chika Nels: Hmmn...

No one would deny the fact that there's a lot to gain from hard work, depends on your seriousness with it.

Don't sit idle, get that thing done!

Introduction : Entrepreneurs bring in change whereas managers continue to work on this change and develop it further.

For Entrepreneurs : 

- Basic necessity of a country, because they generate employment.

- Entrepreneurship is the key to reviving the economy 

- Poverty and unemployment can only be alleviated by creating opportunities

- They have a vision to produce quality products that sell in international markets

Against Entrepreneurs : 

- Managers work towards the maintenance of the organization

- Entrepreneur needs startup money i.e. they require more money to establish.

- Managers are well educated and they work for the welfare of the organization.

- For more and more foreign companies to set up their offices in India, we need trained managers to manage their work. 

Conclusion : Entrepreneurs and managers are the two sides of the same coin. A country like India won't taste success until and unless, entrepreneurs and mangers start to work towards the same goal. Entrepreneurs lay the foundation on which the managers shape up the business.

03/11/2017, 7:39 am - ‪+234 816 245 7659‬: Please PHP vs Node JS which is advisable for backend
03/11/2017, 7:46 am - Tosin Lawal: PHP is easier in a way
03/11/2017, 7:47 am - Tosin Lawal: The boss of it would soon answer you sha
03/11/2017, 7:47 am - Chisom: Actually, node is easier. If you're coming from basic front end, you probably already know JavaScript and you don't have to learn a new language
03/11/2017, 7:50 am - Chisom: Node has a ton of packages to speed things up too
03/11/2017, 7:56 am - Chisom: More job opportunities for PHP though
03/11/2017, 7:58 am - Tosin Lawal: For now sha, node is modern shit
03/11/2017, 8:18 am - Chijioke: If it doesn't have to do with sockets use PHP
03/11/2017, 8:19 am - Chijioke: PHP has the largest community of any language so it has far more resources, per my understanding dot net comes after sef
03/11/2017, 8:20 am - Chijioke: Node is good if you already know javascript and don't really care about Server configs
03/11/2017, 8:21 am - Chijioke: Otherwise mod/cli php is your friend cause should you come under ddos, node is your enemy
03/11/2017, 8:21 am - Chijioke: To be generic, both have their uses and strongholds
03/11/2017, 8:29 am - Chisom: Sockets are part of learning the language
03/11/2017, 8:30 am - Chisom: If you care about server config, it's more node actually
03/11/2017, 8:31 am - Chijioke: But you can't change server files with nodes
03/11/2017, 8:31 am - Chijioke: I mean the server manager now o
03/11/2017, 8:31 am - Chisom: You can
03/11/2017, 8:31 am - Chijioke: Not files you upload to a server
03/11/2017, 8:32 am - Chijioke: That's PHP's Apache
03/11/2017, 8:32 am - Chijioke: What's the Node equivalent?
03/11/2017, 8:32 am - Chisom: Nginx
03/11/2017, 8:32 am - Chijioke: Ohh yh
03/11/2017, 8:32 am - Chijioke: Heard of that befpre
03/11/2017, 8:33 am - Chijioke: I'm doubting you can change some stuffs
03/11/2017, 8:33 am - Chisom: You actually can
03/11/2017, 8:33 am - Chijioke: I mean there's no url rewrite
03/11/2017, 8:33 am - Chijioke: At least in the easy way
03/11/2017, 8:34 am - Chijioke: Such as .htaccess files
03/11/2017, 8:34 am - Chijioke: And banning specific parameters in a request must be done inline in Node
03/11/2017, 8:34 am - Chijioke: That's risky if you are using binary functions
03/11/2017, 8:35 am - Chijioke: Or are there an equivalent of that?
03/11/2017, 8:36 am - Chisom: I'm not exactly sure. I don't really do DevOps
03/11/2017, 8:38 am - Chisom: But load balancing and creating a node cluster in an nginx server to boost performance is proper server config
03/11/2017, 8:38 am - Chijioke: I actually just googled it
03/11/2017, 8:38 am - Chijioke: And saw that you can do rewrite with a work around
03/11/2017, 8:38 am - Chijioke: Using a library
03/11/2017, 8:39 am - Chijioke: And that will only work on the server, the users browser stays the same, you'll need to constantly redirect for it to work on the browser
03/11/2017, 8:39 am - Chijioke: Yh by default
03/11/2017, 8:39 am - Chijioke: That's a good thing
03/11/2017, 8:40 am - Chijioke: But Mysql changed to Mysqli and that now ships with default php packagea
03/11/2017, 8:40 am - Chijioke: That's load balancing
03/11/2017, 8:41 am - Chisom: How long will it take to set up SSL on Apache?

1. Our lecturer can not be available due to some hiccups. He travelled to a remote area recently and the network there is v.bad so he begged for a reschedule. 
Kindly bear with him.

Because I know if many had _friends_ who'd be _useful_ to the hub they'd be here already. The idea to grow is welcome, but we shouldn't compromise quality for quantity, just as @2348069725575 pointed out.
My 2 cents. 😌
04/11/2017, 7:33 pm - Chika Nels: Lol.. I get your point, the aim is to grow all the same. I emphasized on the type of people that would be right for the hub, I also mentioned that we can let me know if you don't have someone in that capacity. 
It's using the medium to remind us that we can invite our like minded friends too, to the hub.
04/11/2017, 7:35 pm - Chika Nels: There is a good reason, we aren't scaling fast and i'm sure we know why.

05/11/2017, 11:55 am - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: When you think of chickens, the word “fly” likely never pops up, unless it’s preceded with “can’t”. Although they are capable of brief bursts of flight, you’ve probably never seen one soaring through the sky. What a sight that would be, huh?


But, as with all things, humanity seeks to find the limits of all things, living or nonliving. We collect these records and compile them into books of feats both wondrous, and dangerous. The chicken is no exception. Believe it or not there exists a record for the longest flight of a chicken. But, first, some history about your favourite fowl.

The Gallus gallus, or chicken, of today’s backyards, were once undomesticated. Odd as it might be to think of chickens clucking through the wild, they actually descend from red, and grey jungle fowl. Evidence suggests a closer tie to the grey, however, as they and the domestic chicken share a yellow skin colouring. Although similar, domestic chickens measure at twice the size of Indian jungle fowl.

Records indicate the domestication of chickens to have taken place over 10,000 years ago when the Indians and Vietnamese captured and bred chickens for eggs, feathers, and meat. This domestication quickly spread throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. As a result, the chicken is the prominent farm animal today.

Unfortunately, this domestication drastically reduced the chicken’s ability to fly. As wild jungle fowl, these birds easily took flight to roost in trees. Now, as domestic creatures, they are purposefully bred to have larger breasts for consumption. This added weight hinders the chicken’s ability to fly. Additionally, chickens are discouraged from wandering or flying off by their handlers, stunting the development of further flying techniques.

That brings us to the matter at hand: what is the longest recorded flight of a chicken? In 2014, a chicken was observed flying for 13 continuous seconds. In addition, the furthest recorded distance covered by a flying chicken is 301.5 feet. Sadly, no other information exists on these record-holding chickens, or if the records are held by the same chicken

05/11/2017, 9:38 pm - Chijioke: The problem is the system, all this is a false sense of liberation

05/11/2017, 9:44 pm - Mvd Wallay: Democracy always produce avaricious characters when number of religious factory outweigh number of logical factories😜 . Democracy in a nation where selected citizens are richer dan the nation, and stronger than the constitution, never expect anything good any ideological framework. Democracy only works effectively  where there's  honesty.
05/11/2017, 9:45 pm - Chijioke: True!
05/11/2017, 9:45 pm - Chijioke: Democracy is the assumption that men will be honest, that men will always act in favor of society
05/11/2017, 9:46 pm - Chijioke: It has been known for millennia that this is false, still our leaders didn't choose real self-determination or return to their ancient Empires

06/11/2017, 9:37 am - Chijioke: Haven't enough races suffered as a result of their ideologies
06/11/2017, 9:38 am - Mvd Wallay: Ambiguity in social science is a tool used to reinforce bewilderment regarding a subject matter.
06/11/2017, 9:38 am - Chijioke: Yes it is, an unpopular perception but held widely among right-wingers
06/11/2017, 9:40 am - Chijioke: Perhaps, except this isn't ambiguous it's a well defined part of their foreign relations
06/11/2017, 9:40 am - Chijioke: A well recorded aspect of their history
06/11/2017, 9:41 am - Chijioke: I mean the World just recorded the 100 year anniversary of the Balfour Declaration
06/11/2017, 9:41 am - Mvd Wallay: I beg to differ. Right wimgers are her conservatives, meaning they portray visible degree of contempt to evolution because it often erode values sacred to them. Centrist are opened to evolution and not even all except the centre-left
06/11/2017, 9:41 am - Mvd Wallay: Whose history?
06/11/2017, 9:41 am - Chijioke: Your definition of evolution is political
06/11/2017, 9:41 am - Chijioke: Westerners
06/11/2017, 9:42 am - Mvd Wallay: Kindly enlighten me about this declaration

06/11/2017, 9:42 am - Chijioke: I believe the impossibility to prove evolution empirically should be noted
06/11/2017, 9:43 am - Mvd Wallay: Are u still talking about gender non conformist group or sth else?
06/11/2017, 9:44 am - Chijioke: No I'm talking about Caucasians

06/11/2017, 9:44 am - Mvd Wallay: Positivist or social constructivist level?
06/11/2017, 9:45 am - Chijioke: USA, England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc these nations are called the West
06/11/2017, 9:45 am - Mvd Wallay: What specifically are you talking bout them, sir?
06/11/2017, 9:45 am - Mosad: It's a misnomer,  an abnormalities  just like Kleptos
06/11/2017, 9:46 am - Mvd Wallay: That's a general wisdom, sir/ma.

06/11/2017, 9:47 am - Mvd Wallay: What's the misnomer here?

06/11/2017, 9:49 am - Chijioke: The Isreal of today didn't exist in 1947
06/11/2017, 9:49 am - Mvd Wallay: Those are topics whose correlation with the topic doesn't tally. Are u saying homosexuality is a western dogma?
06/11/2017, 9:50 am - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: Gay gene....applies to the two
06/11/2017, 9:50 am - Mvd Wallay: Bro we have to focus on one topic. Bringing many components together will challenge a possible common ground
06/11/2017, 9:51 am - Mvd Wallay: No such thing as gay gene, sir/ma.
06/11/2017, 9:51 am - Mosad: Sorry.  That was not the word i intended to use.  homosexuality is  abnormal
06/11/2017, 9:53 am - Mvd Wallay: Alright. Has humanity reached the final stage of evolution?
06/11/2017, 9:53 am - Chijioke: Exactly! That's what I'm saying, and they tally because in order to understand how homosexuality is being spread and propagated by all means popularlt used by the West one must first understand what this propaganda are meant to do so they tally with the initial statement of population control' coupled with a false sense of liberalism and other nonsense

And before you go on to say 'homosexuality exists everywhere and has always existed in African society' we must first understand that homosexuality is a culture on it's own, a way of life, one that tells children/teenagers they can 'identify sexually' this isn't just compatible with African society
06/11/2017, 9:54 am - Mosad: Exactly!  There was never and will never be.  It was made up to justify the illness.  If stealing isn't a generally negative act,  kleptomaniacs would have defended their urge to steal as inborn.
06/11/2017, 9:54 am - Chijioke: Homosexuality is not a phase of evolution!
06/11/2017, 9:55 am - Chijioke: It is impossible for a being to identify by itself that it is evolving
06/11/2017, 9:55 am - Chijioke: Evolution must also be scientific!!!
06/11/2017, 9:55 am - Mvd Wallay: Do u know that prior convergence with the Caucasians, homosexuality and onanism existed in Africa?  Painful that we attributed all social consciousness to the western axis.
06/11/2017, 9:56 am - Chijioke: You clearly didn't read what I wrote
06/11/2017, 9:56 am - Mosad: Dude! Take 👍🏿 chop 🤜🏿 mehnnn!
06/11/2017, 9:56 am - Mvd Wallay: This assertion has connotations of homophobia.
06/11/2017, 9:56 am - Chijioke: Cause in the second paragraph I anticipated and replied to this
06/11/2017, 9:57 am - Chijioke: This assertion has connotations of homofacism
06/11/2017, 9:57 am - Mosad: Homophobia?  How did that word became popular?
06/11/2017, 9:57 am - Mvd Wallay: Check the lobi tribe and other tribes in Africa, u will realise that homosexuality is cultural to some African tribes.
06/11/2017, 9:59 am - Mvd Wallay: Humans find a word for every discovered consciousness. The fact technology help in fostering awareness doesnt imply homosexuality is a western construct.
06/11/2017, 9:59 am - Chijioke: And we then alter our values because a tribe of 160,000 people practise different? HOMOFACISM!!!
06/11/2017, 9:59 am - Chijioke: Every tribe in Nigeria FORBIDS it
06/11/2017, 9:59 am - Chijioke: And there are over 200 million of us
06/11/2017, 10:00 am - Mvd Wallay: Africa isnt limited to Nigeria. Consider exploring the African continent in totality.
06/11/2017, 10:01 am - Chijioke: Yes it isn't almost every other forbids it
06/11/2017, 10:01 am - Mvd Wallay: Nigeria is just meagre part of Africa. There are scores of unidentical cultures in Africa
06/11/2017, 10:01 am - Chijioke: And frankly everyone should practice their tradition fully!
06/11/2017, 10:01 am - Chijioke: No one should hinder it
06/11/2017, 10:01 am - Chijioke: But the thing is you misunderstand what homosexuality truly is
06/11/2017, 10:02 am - Mvd Wallay: Most forbid it but not all. In the phase of monarchy, liberalism was an abomination.
06/11/2017, 10:02 am - Chijioke: Homosexuality is more than sexual relations with same sex individuals
06/11/2017, 10:03 am - Chijioke: "In the phase of monarchy, liberalism was an abomination" where did you get this?
06/11/2017, 10:03 am - Chijioke: Let's even talk of today's examples
06/11/2017, 10:03 am - Mosad: I seriously don't get your point here.
06/11/2017, 10:03 am - Chijioke: We have Qatar, England, Netherlands
06/11/2017, 10:03 am - Chijioke: All extremely liberal
06/11/2017, 10:03 am - Chijioke: .
06/11/2017, 10:03 am - Mvd Wallay: All constructions/values are product of consciousness. No social value is natural. Even your name is artificial. Gender roles were  socially constructed
06/11/2017, 10:04 am - Chijioke: Yes true
06/11/2017, 10:04 am - Chijioke: And we won't be changing our social constructs for anyone
06/11/2017, 10:04 am - Chijioke: Those Westerners can all hang!
06/11/2017, 10:05 am - Mvd Wallay: Oh thats an analogy bro. Meaning homosexuality is bound to be a taboo to some African culture because it is a new consciousness. This is a clash of civilisation
06/11/2017, 10:05 am - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: Can admin pls change the group name?
06/11/2017, 10:05 am - Chijioke: African tradition cannot have men kissing on streets or men dressed like women,
Listen homosexuality is a culture of it's own and cannot thrive in Africa
06/11/2017, 10:05 am - Chijioke: It's simple
06/11/2017, 10:05 am - Chijioke: All these are Western social conflicts
06/11/2017, 10:06 am - Mvd Wallay: This has connotation of racism. Lets be objective as much as possible in our analysis.
06/11/2017, 10:06 am - Chijioke: We are unserious with leadership here otherwise this won't even be heard of
06/11/2017, 10:07 am - Mvd Wallay: Alright. But explore African culture in totality to have new data revealed to u.
06/11/2017, 10:07 am - Chijioke: First I'm black! I have well within my power to be hostile to people that want to attack me ideologically
06/11/2017, 10:07 am - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Well to an  extent do we understand the difference between westernization and modernization?
06/11/2017, 10:07 am - Mosad: Yes.  U can see what they have done.  African imbibed so much from them and try so hard to be like them.  We even try to reason like them.  Just like our guy here who is defending homosexuality as a normality.
06/11/2017, 10:07 am - Chijioke: Do you hear Asian nations like China discuss this?
06/11/2017, 10:07 am - Mvd Wallay: So only the westerners are capable of evolution? Africans are static, right?
06/11/2017, 10:08 am - Chijioke: How are we static
06/11/2017, 10:08 am - Mvd Wallay: They surely exist there too.
06/11/2017, 10:08 am - Chijioke: How does what I said identify or relate to being static?
06/11/2017, 10:08 am - Chijioke: That's not my question
06/11/2017, 10:08 am - Mvd Wallay: It is a question i asked based on your assertion.
06/11/2017, 10:08 am - Chijioke: Do they discuss it?
06/11/2017, 10:09 am - Mosad: Asian Nations where homosexuality is a taboo?  Indonesia,  Cambodia?  They have more offensive names than Faggots
06/11/2017, 10:09 am - Chijioke: But the question is a digression
06/11/2017, 10:09 am - Mvd Wallay: Who ask questions or press for rights under a steel cage dictatorship.
06/11/2017, 10:10 am - Chijioke: We keep importing Western Social Conflicts and it has never helped us
06/11/2017, 10:10 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Theft you say???
Who were the citizen of Palestine before then?
06/11/2017, 10:10 am - Mosad: They neednt discuss it because their cultures frown so much at it.  Last time i checked   China places their culture first above others.
06/11/2017, 10:10 am - Mvd Wallay: Do u know men sleep with men foe spiritual fortification in Africa. Very common within the hunters.
06/11/2017, 10:10 am - Chijioke: Ok let's say we accept homosexuality tomorrow,   do the far more pressing issues vanish?
06/11/2017, 10:11 am - Chijioke: Palestinians
06/11/2017, 10:11 am - Chijioke: So, what does this have to do with homosexuality as I've established?
06/11/2017, 10:12 am - Mvd Wallay: Bias consolidated in the 3 monotheistic constitutions will never let us find the truth. Groupism is the problem here.
06/11/2017, 10:12 am - Babajide Martins: Just facts..
06/11/2017, 10:12 am - Mosad: U said Spiritual Fortification.  You said it.  Just as some people are made to eat Feaces for wealth.  Those it make it normal?
06/11/2017, 10:12 am - Chijioke: Irrelevant fact, a digression
06/11/2017, 10:13 am - Babajide Martins: Meh...
You guys should seamer down with these big words..
06/11/2017, 10:13 am - Mvd Wallay: Many. Just letting u know the etymology of homosexuality in Africa
06/11/2017, 10:13 am - Chijioke: I've said, I'm well aware that it existed and that everyone loved and lived in peace with it
06/11/2017, 10:13 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: And it consisted of Bedouins, druids, Arabs and Jews...
06/11/2017, 10:13 am - Chijioke: This is what African society is known for
06/11/2017, 10:13 am - Chijioke: Barely Jews
06/11/2017, 10:13 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: What do you think it's the truth??
06/11/2017, 10:14 am - Mvd Wallay: That's not a cultural thing. The lobi tribe practice homosexuality as a cultural value. Check  it online.
06/11/2017, 10:14 am - Mosad: See justifications.  Acts that people get punished for in those days.
06/11/2017, 10:15 am - Chijioke: We can't have homosexual practice similar to/that westernised Africa, let us practice our tradition in peace
06/11/2017, 10:15 am - Chijioke: They need to keep their HomoFacism
06/11/2017, 10:15 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: But they also where there...
The problems began when the exile Jews decided to return to their ancestral land due to the rise of anti-Semitism..
06/11/2017, 10:15 am - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: The point is we have failed to embrace what makes us Africans, homosexuality is completely alien to the African tradition as the idea of conjugal bliss is revered.
More important our value of what the family is.. The family in Africa is such that a man and a woman have different roles that are complementary to the development of the society.. So for instance the men are expected to work and provide for the family. The woman is expected to play a supporting role to see the welfare of the money .. Now the western idea of feminism have devalued the African woman to  believe her role is secondary rather than complementary.. The African women is know to also to work and contribute her own quota to the development of the family.
Now the construct of Africans is on the family and communalism which the westerners never had never enjoyed. As such there quest at looking at experiencing wat the  Africans have expressed is what has led them to exploring such relationships

Now let take a vivid look at it compare the concept of family in the African society to that of the Western Society you would see that there is a dysfunctional trend in the Western Society.. 
So it for me amaze me to see people who have values others are looking for chasing what does not identify with them
06/11/2017, 10:15 am - Chijioke: Nope
06/11/2017, 10:16 am - Mvd Wallay: Virtuoso, please explore the lobi tribe cultural rituals.
06/11/2017, 10:16 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Do you know that homosexuality is deeply practiced in some regions of Afghanistan??🤣🤣
06/11/2017, 10:16 am - Chijioke: The Balfour declaration was orchestrated by Zionism and was intended to lead to a Jewish state, all this happened long before Hitler took power
06/11/2017, 10:16 am - Mvd Wallay: Yes tellem.
06/11/2017, 10:16 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Ok...
Tell me
06/11/2017, 10:17 am - Mosad: Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed.  They were also practising it too.
06/11/2017, 10:17 am - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Permit my errors
06/11/2017, 10:17 am - Mvd Wallay: Bible is a thesis. A fiction
06/11/2017, 10:17 am - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: An oral account😂😂
06/11/2017, 10:18 am - Chijioke: Exactly, let them practice their thing in peace
06/11/2017, 10:18 am - Chijioke: You can't start telling men to dress like women or to peck on the road
06/11/2017, 10:18 am - Mvd Wallay: 🤣🤣🤣 cant be used as an empirical data.
06/11/2017, 10:18 am - Chijioke: Because it interferes wit their tradition
06/11/2017, 10:18 am - Chijioke: Let them be
06/11/2017, 10:19 am - Chijioke: Actually that account, Sodom and Gomorrah is the one account I know that was proven
06/11/2017, 10:19 am - Mosad: Killing of twins was deeply practiced in Calabar,  Female Genital Mutilation is still being practiced here in Africa as a cultural thing.  Does it make it right?
06/11/2017, 10:19 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: From what I read.....
Due to the rise of Jews in Palestine ......the clashes between Arabs and Jews increased..... Which leads to the creation of separate states
06/11/2017, 10:19 am - Mvd Wallay: It existed in Africa prior European invasion. It was even practiced in the ancient Egypt
06/11/2017, 10:20 am - Chijioke: I don't know how you'll call the bible a fiction, there are documents in Jerusalem that back up a lot of it's tales
06/11/2017, 10:20 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Nope....
What am saying is, it is not a western thing..
06/11/2017, 10:20 am - Mvd Wallay: Were you there?
06/11/2017, 10:20 am - Chijioke: What you read is false
06/11/2017, 10:20 am - Mvd Wallay: 😍😍😍
06/11/2017, 10:20 am - Chijioke: Google the Balfour Declaration
06/11/2017, 10:21 am - Chijioke: They have empirical evidence for it's occurrence, I don't need to be there
06/11/2017, 10:21 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: So how do you know yours is true??😏
06/11/2017, 10:21 am - Chijioke: Or have you seen an atom before?
06/11/2017, 10:21 am - Chijioke: I read
06/11/2017, 10:21 am - Chijioke: You can also check www.aljazeera.com for factual tales
06/11/2017, 10:22 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Tell me how the states where partitioned?
06/11/2017, 10:22 am - Mosad: I knew u were an atheist the moment u started this.   They are the ones that trt so hard not to believe and defend their beliefs so hard with 1 + 1=2
06/11/2017, 10:23 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Lol
Al-Jazeera is not biased towards the Jews😏😏
06/11/2017, 10:23 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Same with me
06/11/2017, 10:23 am - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: Let stop this ....i beg
06/11/2017, 10:24 am - Chijioke: According to history, England only fell for/agreed to the Zionist manipulation because of a dissatisfaction with a deal signed with France relating to Palestinian land, as such presenting the "Jewish return to their ancestral homeland" was an appropriate reason to discontinue the agreement as a "Christain" France would pay attention to that
06/11/2017, 10:24 am - Chijioke: Aljazeera is hardly ever biased
06/11/2017, 10:25 am - Chijioke: They only news outlet with Western reporters that calls out the USA's bullshit!
06/11/2017, 10:26 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Same Al-Jazeera that called rebels fighting Gaddafi and al Assad freedom fighters😏😏😏
06/11/2017, 10:27 am - Mvd Wallay: They not you, right?
06/11/2017, 10:27 am - Chijioke: What surprises me about Atheists, Liberals and Conservatives is that despite the fact that everyone is advocating equality and freedom, you are all trying to silence one another
06/11/2017, 10:28 am - Mvd Wallay: Y did u exclude the theist axis?
06/11/2017, 10:28 am - Chijioke: Look at most Western nations, a conservative isn't allowed to speak on issues that genuinely affect them, why can't they genuinely reject foreign presence on their land
06/11/2017, 10:28 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Initially Palestine was composed of various both Jewish and Arab states......
But because of the hate the Arabs had for the jews, they decided to take them out of the picture...
We all know how that ended up...
06/11/2017, 10:28 am - Chijioke: All inclusive sir
06/11/2017, 10:29 am - Chijioke: Once again this is false
06/11/2017, 10:30 am - Mvd Wallay: U didnt include d theist
06/11/2017, 10:30 am - Chijioke: Rather than work together to find a way forward everyone is dragging superiority, better focus on your own society
06/11/2017, 10:30 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: So what you are saying is..
The 1948 war didn't happen,.... The six day war, Oct war????🤷🏽‍♂
06/11/2017, 10:31 am - Chijioke: Global white population is declining, before you said it's "racism", like they say facts and blacks cannot be racist
06/11/2017, 10:31 am - Mosad: Homosexuality.  They couldn't even use the theory of evolution to buttress their points. Turned an illness into being normal.  Watch out how they will make Beastiality a normal thing soon.  It has already started.  Then our smart people in Africa will start defending the act too because a white man/woman has done most of the thinking for us
06/11/2017, 10:32 am - Mvd Wallay: Homophobia
06/11/2017, 10:32 am - Chijioke: All this were wars outside of Isreal entirly, while our subject matter is the theft of Palestinian land
06/11/2017, 10:32 am - Chijioke: Homofascism
06/11/2017, 10:33 am - Mvd Wallay: Homophobia too is a psychopathology. It is ethnocentrism, a type of dogma.
06/11/2017, 10:33 am - Chijioke: One thing I know is that the topic died down significantly when Jonathan signed the Anti-homosexuality bill
06/11/2017, 10:33 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: All relating to Palestine
06/11/2017, 10:34 am - Chijioke: So in our political sphere "Buhari's corruption" is more pressing than "Gayness"
06/11/2017, 10:35 am - Chijioke: Ethnocentric on the part of Homofacists not Homophobics
06/11/2017, 10:35 am - Mosad: The hell is Homophobia?  We don't like thieves.  What are we?  THIEFRYPHOBIC?  I know a mad man should be hospitalized.  Am i INSANOPHIA?   there is no such thing as Homophobia.  The West taught you that.  They made you believe it's normal and you fell for the bait.
06/11/2017, 10:36 am - Mvd Wallay: Homosexuals dont hate heterosexual. Only heterosexuals detest homosexuals.
06/11/2017, 10:36 am - Chijioke: Cause they are looking onto others solely with the perspective of their own culture and not that it is taboo by the culture of others
06/11/2017, 10:36 am - Chijioke: False!
06/11/2017, 10:36 am - Chijioke: !!!!!!!!
06/11/2017, 10:37 am - Mvd Wallay: Homophobia is a psychopathology traceable to dogma. It is a mental disorder.
06/11/2017, 10:37 am - Mvd Wallay: Dont u detest gender non comformist?
06/11/2017, 10:38 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Personally I don't mind homosexuality..........

06/11/2017, 10:38 am - Babajide Martins: Son*
06/11/2017, 10:38 am - Chijioke: Why do I have to detest anybody, all I know is that if you attack my tradition, I'll attack you!
06/11/2017, 10:38 am - Chijioke: It's simple!
06/11/2017, 10:38 am - Chijioke: An eye for 2 eyes
06/11/2017, 11:04 am - Chika Nels changed the subject from "e-Learn Lect by 7pm📖" to "e-Learn Hub"

Get sense. Talk straight. Lay your points bare n move on.

06/11/2017, 10:45 am - Chijioke: Look anyone saying accept homosexuality irrespective of your beliefs or tradition, is ideological imposing on you
06/11/2017, 10:45 am - Chijioke: And that's homofacism!
06/11/2017, 10:46 am - Akanni Hafeez: How you too know like this CJ🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
06/11/2017, 10:47 am - Babajide Martins: Lol
06/11/2017, 10:47 am - Chijioke: *ideologically
06/11/2017, 10:51 am - Chijioke: This Westerners think they can attack us ideologically without consequences
06/11/2017, 10:52 am - Chijioke: I must one day rule this continent and show them!
06/11/2017, 10:52 am - Chijioke: When we start advocating men and women dress half naked like African tribes let's see how they'll like it
06/11/2017, 10:53 am - Mosad: the first solution to a problem is  ACCEPTANCE.  Accepting that a problem exist solves half of that problem. DENIAL on the other hand worsens the problem . It later turns you to that problem. people have fakes so many things until it became part of them and then they start using phrases like " i was born with it " to deceive themselves further.  I have seen... holla! do u know there are factors that can make one to gay? Just as there are factors that can make one steal.  Have you heard a tout justifying his reason for being a menace? Have you heard a prostitute justifying her reason for sleeping with dozens of different men everynight?
06/11/2017, 10:53 am - Mvd Wallay: Isaw them during my field research
06/11/2017, 10:53 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: And also putting on G-string ( the gods must be crazy style )
06/11/2017, 10:57 am - Mosad: we were doing that and they called us barbaric, now they are doing the same and calling themselves fashionistas . I swear! Africans need to rise above these inferiority complex. esp Nigerians who try so hard to please and be like the West. See how someone has read journals written by a biased Westerner and he has started defending gay rights . see na. JUST NEGODO!
06/11/2017, 10:57 am - Mvd Wallay: 😍😍😍😍
06/11/2017, 10:58 am - Chijioke: Lool
06/11/2017, 10:58 am - Chijioke: It's very funny to me

06/11/2017, 10:59 am - Akanni Hafeez: 🤣🤣🤣. You saw this during ur field research.  Lie. The first statement is not justifiable as sth u say. It's documented acct too, and oral first.
06/11/2017, 10:59 am - Mosad: @MVD . Are you a nairalander?\
06/11/2017, 10:59 am - Mvd Wallay: Liberalism isnt hypocritical, it only appears as such when tampered by human.
06/11/2017, 11:00 am - Akanni Hafeez: That's why they choose to be. Man is his problem no matter religion.
06/11/2017, 11:01 am - Mvd Wallay: U can go to east africa if u really wanna see it. Might share few videos here tonight .
06/11/2017, 11:01 am - Chijioke: 😦. Liberalism is a social construct so it is inherently tampered by humans
06/11/2017, 11:02 am - Akanni Hafeez: Everything is tampered by humans. I just dey laugh. Everything can be...that's y atheist, liberals freethinkers n all love to attack it and draw people to their own religion found on denial n attacks on other forms or types cos of the faults of men in those.
06/11/2017, 11:02 am - Akanni Hafeez: Leave am!
06/11/2017, 11:04 am - Mvd Wallay: Everything is a social construct except reproduction. Even anatomy and physiology can be reconstructed dis day.
06/11/2017, 11:04 am - Akanni Hafeez: Lol. Videos, how were videos formed? Lemme epp u...knowledge. How do people know? Communication... Basic communication?? Oral...

06/11/2017, 11:05 am - Mosad: are u a nairalander?
06/11/2017, 11:06 am - Akanni Hafeez: Na who do documentary? Lol. What's the basic idea of documenting stuff? Documentary sef get grades n types na...I can depict sth that happened a billion year ago by pictures n graphics n stuff gotten today... All na based in wetin we know based on wetin we think say we don find...
06/11/2017, 11:08 am - Akanni Hafeez: E dey sweet as madness they fly anywhere... Instead of reason together, person go fly go any forum collect thoughts dey pour out....
06/11/2017, 11:08 am - Akanni Hafeez: I no sabi argue abeh
06/11/2017, 11:09 am - Mvd Wallay: U can go to east africa to verify d data. Thanks
06/11/2017, 11:10 am - Chijioke: Lol you are basing your arguments on motion pictures?
06/11/2017, 11:10 am - Chijioke: Try and read the practices up on the practices of African tribes, individually
06/11/2017, 11:11 am - Chijioke: Especially those written by Africans residing in Africa
06/11/2017, 11:11 am - Chijioke: And documented practices
06/11/2017, 11:11 am - Chijioke: Don't go for Hollywood images as a justification for whatever stance you have
06/11/2017, 11:11 am - Chijioke: Everything that comes out of there is almost always a lie
06/11/2017, 11:12 am - Akanni Hafeez: Picture motions based on things bro read, things bro read based on things that were said n documented yet bro stands to yab Bible. I have sha said my own...live talking against the Bible here or even any other religion... Let's reason
06/11/2017, 11:12 am - Chijioke: Exactly!
06/11/2017, 11:13 am - Chijioke: A documentary cannot be the basis of the admittance of any form of evidence.
06/11/2017, 11:14 am - Chijioke: It is well known that hollywood is a propaganda arm of the US government, the more reason you'll never find their movies in certain developed nations
06/11/2017, 11:14 am - Akanni Hafeez: If I haven't said nothing against atheism n any other religion biko, I have too much soft spot for my faith n book. Stay your lane. If you continue, you only give me more fun. I'd still stay on this group even if the devil was here cos he sef sabi God's word as true n I can well use him to my advantage better than any man, creed or denial n attack or ill talk about the Bible.
06/11/2017, 11:14 am - Chijioke: It's supposed to spread divisive views
06/11/2017, 11:15 am - Akanni Hafeez: And his counterpart say oral account that cannot be used as empirical evidence. See as your seeming knowledge they mock you...

CJ EPP me laugh small o
06/11/2017, 11:16 am - Chijioke: Every attack on the Bible always meets me as funny, I know enough about science to know that it is far more inexact than the Bible can ever be, you really can't base your arguments against the Bible on Science
06/11/2017, 11:18 am - Chijioke: At best just argue that Jesus Christ was a magician cause too many people witnessed his miracles and documented them both in Qur'anic books and other historical pieces for anyone to claim they are false, or I'm supposed to believe your "Big Bang Theory" over the Bible's creation tales
06/11/2017, 11:19 am - Chijioke: That's ridiculous considering the BBT can never be proven
06/11/2017, 11:20 am - Akanni Hafeez: Lets leave matter jor.
06/11/2017, 11:20 am - Mosad: i currently do not have carrots to spice your noodles with. how do u even want it? watery or stone hard?
I have watched a White professor disgusted as how his people rewrote Egyptian history. They turned all great leaders of Egypyt White. This professor researched and came up that Pharoah,Ramsey and some notable Egyptian rulers have more chances of being black than white .   He came with so much proofs and also gave tons of examples of how Hollywood feed us lies and make us believe nonsense. MVD , u might be reading the wrong history and research journals.
06/11/2017, 11:21 am - Akanni Hafeez: Reason on... Yab the Bible all you want. It's still the most criticised book. And I'd defend the Qur'an sef where I know it's truth is thwarted... So far it's all left to man. All na fk whether JFK or Fani Kayode!
06/11/2017, 11:22 am - Chijioke: Actually this is well known, in the US, people of Egyptian descent are classified as being 'White'
06/11/2017, 11:22 am - Chijioke: This is the 21st century
06/11/2017, 11:23 am - Chijioke: I read a story I believe on New York times where an Egyptian man was fighting to have him reclassified as Black so that he could access social amenities only extended to Blacks
06/11/2017, 11:24 am - Chijioke: All you have to do to be White washed is to build something fancy like the Pyramids
06/11/2017, 11:25 am - Akanni Hafeez: You see...we fail note that the Bible didn't fall from heaven... Lemme stop short here to say I'm enjoying all the jokes against it. God ain't moved, men died for it, men enslaved men with it, men freed men with it. Man is the issue. In fact God's sovereignty is as far as man allows anything. The reason for the heaven is the earth, the reason for the earth is man, the reason for man is God. Fight it all you want, brand it in the name of any religion, creed, faith, belief system or denial n establishment or any against all this.
06/11/2017, 11:25 am - Chijioke: Imagine the popular phrase "So-So and So discovered Lake Victoria in Africa"

A little drift into Socioeconomic analysis

Did Abacha steal from us or was he a saviour - the monetary economics approach

So which one should we flesh up a bit

Trust me, it will be discussed with so much live

06/11/2017, 7:30 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Okay
06/11/2017, 7:35 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: You're right
06/11/2017, 7:36 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: I can't wait to see how you'll justify Abacha's actions🙄
06/11/2017, 7:39 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: ??

06/11/2017, 7:40 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I must say that Abacha is not a saint and I'm only here to do a brief analysis about his government
06/11/2017, 7:43 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: While Abacha isn't a saint, none of his critics too were saints
06/11/2017, 7:43 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: But talking about his monetary views, one can easily deduce that the military dictator had the future of Nigeria in mind while perpetuating  what many people later tagged as evik
06/11/2017, 7:43 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: *evil
06/11/2017, 7:43 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: We all heard about several of his vices but none has been said about his good deeds
06/11/2017, 7:44 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If juxtaposing this good deeds with those of his successors and predecessors, one can easily say that the media was rather too harsh on him
06/11/2017, 7:45 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The Abacha loots
06/11/2017, 7:49 pm - Chika Nels: Me too😁👀
06/11/2017, 7:49 pm - Chika Nels: Ah!
06/11/2017, 7:49 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: It should be noted that almost what was tagged Abacha's loot were not domiciled in Nigeria
06/11/2017, 7:49 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: What could have been the reason for this action
06/11/2017, 7:55 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: How is that a Blessing to our generation?

It is said that too much money in the economy causes inflation and inflation will always cripple the economy by bringing a financial crisis into the economy. 

I'm sure everyone is aware of the Zimbabwean monetary crisis when an egg was sold for almost a billion Zimbabwean dollars - this happened because the President printed too much money and all the money were kept in the economy.
So Abacha keeping his loot (I will still clarify if it's a loot or not) abroad saved us from a similar crisis. Don't you think we should be thankful for this wisdom  not forgetting that similar Military Dictators used their loots to destabilise the economy (Babangida and the 5 million dollars, Buhari and the Petrodollars, Abiola/IBB/ITT loot and others so many to be mentioned)
06/11/2017, 7:57 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: So within the tenure of General Sanni Abacha: everyone enjoyed a relative stable price level in the market compared to his successors' or predecessors'
06/11/2017, 8:01 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Okay 
I will address the issue from the point of personality and institution.
May I begin by saying that Abacha is the only Non Nigerian who ruled Nigeria.. To our surprise Ababcha is originally from Niger .. His father however brought is family to Nigeria and Abacha was able to join the Nigerian Army owing to the porosity and infiltration that occurred in the Nigerian Army then.. So for a start he never had that foundational affinity with Nigeria. 
Secondly the Institution that produced him is the military. The Military where in the helms of affair between 1966-1999 in which Abacha ruled from 1994-1998.. Now there is a saying that the worst democratic government is better than the best Military government. Abacha came into power by the barrel of the gun that was not shot (there was no bloody coup). To his financial misappropriation..
We cannot say that he is a saviour of the Nigerian state in the sense that the process of transferring and diverting Nigeria Wealth to a foreign country was not accountable. Is the money domiciled in Nigeria's Name in those foreign countries?
Where there not banks in Nigeria as at 1994 why was the money not kept there?
What if the money was sufficiently invested in Infrastructure like Electricity, Education and Good Roads .. Do we know how much returns we would have gotten and how far we would have developed as a country ?
And the money kept in another man's country becomes traceable there and it is used to develop that country.. The money that is kept in those foreign countries are what world powers use to fuel there neo colonialists organisation like IMF , Works Bank who in turn offer us dubious loans that we end up not paying..
Look at cycle of impoverishment.. We siphon money to develop another man country dey In turn borrow us the money and we often times dont even no how to pay back
06/11/2017, 8:02 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: *tradable
06/11/2017, 8:04 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: So for me he was never a savior he only contributed is own quota to the leadership deficiency we had in Nigeria..
06/11/2017, 8:06 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Now, you cannot fault the fact that Abacha became Head of State despite the fact that his family wasn't of Nigerian decent. He was enrolled into Nigerian military as a Nigerian and come to think of it, is Obama of American decent?
06/11/2017, 8:06 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Well by affinity is was born there
06/11/2017, 8:07 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: *he
06/11/2017, 8:08 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: But was Abacha not a registered Nigerian soldier who fought for the safety of the nation? 
Had it been he died fighting for Nigeria, would he had been tagged otherwise?
06/11/2017, 8:09 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Why do you think he should be deprived everything a Nigerian soldier has the right to enjoy?
06/11/2017, 8:10 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: And mind you, there was no law that states clearly of his illegality to rule as at his time of Presidency
06/11/2017, 8:10 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: The question of fighting is a pledge that comes with the job.. My point if things where in order he would have not been in the Nigerian Army.. He is regarded as one of the most brutal President Nigeria ever had that is lineage had to be traced den it was revealed that he was never a Nigerian
06/11/2017, 8:11 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Who tagged him brutal?
06/11/2017, 8:14 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I'm not saying he's a saint and  I am not justifying military rule but it is an obvious fact that most structural (institutions) infrastructural and Ideological development in Nigeria took place during the Military era
06/11/2017, 8:17 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Ken Saro Wiwo and Nine Ogoni Chiefs where killed that immediately brought hostility from the international community
Killing of Kudirat Abiola 
Continuous Detention of Abiola
Soyinka wanted Dead 
Jail Obasanjo for a false coup attempt..
The international community declared him brutal.
Do u realise that the death of ken Saro Wiwa  and 9 Ogoni Chiefs led gave birth to the militancy in the South South
06/11/2017, 8:30 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Also, I must add by saying governance is more technical than we think
06/11/2017, 8:41 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: There is a limit to what the government can pump into projects and infrastructure development in a year. If otherwise, the nation can end up in depression: overproduction and general unemployment
06/11/2017, 8:42 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: And also, those large amount of money couldn't have been kept in any bank in Nigeria as it will be a bad loss to the economy (that's the reason the CBN increases the Reserve requirements Ratio of Banks once it's discovered that there's too much money saved)
06/11/2017, 8:46 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Have you ever been bittered about how volatile Nigerian naira is compared to other currencies?

This is simply as a result of reserves
06/11/2017, 8:47 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: .
06/11/2017, 8:47 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: .

06/11/2017, 8:48 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: These are explanations on how the developed countries are strengthening their currencies
06/11/2017, 8:48 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: As a defence to Abacha's overseas deposit of loot, it can be argued that those loots stood as a defence for naira as they earned foreign exchange in interests.

Note that the loots were of Nigerian origin and were domiciled in Naira so they will be added to the net Foreign Exchange Balance which will somewhat offset the high demand for Foreign currencies in the domestic economy
06/11/2017, 8:48 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Now Abiola was a very corrupt man that I believed should not be praised as a hero in anyway
06/11/2017, 8:48 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: And as I have said before, General Sanni Abacha wasn't a saint but a lesser evil
06/11/2017, 8:56 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: You must be aware that he wasn't a friend of the West and anybody who isn't a friend of the West is tagged brutal and the media will always seek to make a nonentity.

Ghadaffi's Libya is way better than the aftermath of the invasion
Sadam Hussein's Iraq is more successful economically than the aftermath of US & the West's occupation
06/11/2017, 8:56 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The basis of this brief lecture or discussion is to bring out some of the good deeds of the Abacha regime and also appreciate his foresight
06/11/2017, 8:57 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Abacha constituted political parties with a bid to handover to Civilian rule but it was frustrated by some juggernauts because it wasn't favourable to them
06/11/2017, 8:57 pm - Chika Nels: Why Sir?  He had the people at heart and was very generous
06/11/2017, 8:57 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Also, Abacha formulated several economic development plans. One of which was tagged Vision 2010
06/11/2017, 8:57 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: ITT.. International Thief Thief
06/11/2017, 8:58 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: This was actually International Telephone and Telecommunications....
06/11/2017, 8:58 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: He formed what Bola I've referred to as as Five hands of a leper
06/11/2017, 8:59 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Yeah sure
06/11/2017, 8:59 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: That's one of the biggest corporate heist in the history of Nigeria
06/11/2017, 9:02 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Was it not because it was unfavourable to the Afenifere's subgroup
06/11/2017, 9:03 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Or why did you think Bola Ige decided to start the Yoruba Elders Forum or joined the Obasanjo-PDP led administration
06/11/2017, 9:08 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: All these were because Ige's ambition wasn't supported by the political parties and they used their wit to frustrate that effort
06/11/2017, 9:08 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: So I must say that Abacha could have been tagged brutal but *he was a Supreme Military Dictator who had a foresight despite his brutality*
06/11/2017, 9:08 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Everyone is hailing China and their development stride but no one has ever decried the brutality under Mao Zedong
06/11/2017, 9:08 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Thomas Sankara wasn't free of brutality yet he ruled better than most Presidents of the world
06/11/2017, 9:11 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I want us to dig in to the past, appreciate the good side of Abachas and his excesses and also decry the evils of the patriotic shenanigans who paraded themselves as our leaders
06/11/2017, 9:11 pm - Mosad: History History.   Skewd histories here and there.   We read what someone wants us to read.    Iroyin ko to afojuba.  Continue.

06/11/2017, 9:12 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: How did the ₦57million NEPA scam end under Ige's watch as Minister of Power and Steel?
06/11/2017, 9:15 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The billions of dollars owed by Samuel Doe of Liberia kept with Abiola by IBB that got missing within the Abiola's family will can't be forgotten in a moment
06/11/2017, 9:16 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: One of the best way is to read several reports of newspapers present at those times.

Tell Magazine, Tribune, Daily Times, Pyramids and other papers of those years still exist in several libraries across Nigeria...

If you can trace the date of any event, get several papers preceding that date & after that date.. that way you will get diverse fresh views about the event... That's true history
06/11/2017, 9:16 pm - Mosad: A first hand experience narrative.  😉
06/11/2017, 9:16 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Another way of getting history is to read first hand narratives that were published in not too distant years
06/11/2017, 9:17 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Well when you say several, I guess you meant those with opposing views
06/11/2017, 9:17 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: But most of them are dead
06/11/2017, 9:17 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Yes sir
06/11/2017, 9:18 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: 👍🏼
Cos news outlets this days are mouthpiece of various groups
06/11/2017, 9:19 pm - Mosad: Unfortunately It died with them and some of them alive to say it are not saying the truth or are sentimental.
06/11/2017, 9:19 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Once read that one of the cause of the French downfall during the early years of the second world war was their newspapers
06/11/2017, 9:20 pm - Mosad: Just like i had read that Bbc was an instrument to Nigerian Civil war
06/11/2017, 9:21 pm - Mosad: Dr Obasan.  Pls carry on.
06/11/2017, 9:21 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If you want to know much about Biafra

Get a book by OJUKWU, Gowon, My Command by Obasanjo (cos he was the GOC in charge of the Command that won the war or accepted the truce) and other veteran players
06/11/2017, 9:21 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: That's a cool way to authenticate histories cos people often doctor history to suit
06/11/2017, 9:21 pm - ‪+234 812 093 8116‬: I'm really enjoying this lecture
06/11/2017, 9:22 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: 💪🏿👏🏿🔥 read those books.. Why we Struck shud be included
06/11/2017, 9:23 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Dunno about that......
But the French where very overconfident..... Encouraged by their newspapers.....it is even said that German spies bought advertisement spaces to increase and spread misinformation through the French papers
06/11/2017, 9:23 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: 👏🏿👏🏿  this is true ... The current newsprint already of have an infiltration
06/11/2017, 9:23 pm - Chika Nels: 👌🏼
06/11/2017, 9:24 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: I read one written by a Foreign journalist..
Can't remember the name.... The best so far for me
06/11/2017, 9:24 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Insightful 👏🏿
06/11/2017, 9:24 pm - Mosad: Cornelius?  Where is he?  Are u guys aware we have a Ghanaian in our mist?  We might be boring him with our history.   Salute to Rawlings ✌🏽
06/11/2017, 9:25 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: 🙌🏼
Pls carry on...
Forgive my intrusion
06/11/2017, 9:25 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Another great guy.. I read somewhere where Rawlings said he was offered 5 million dollars by Abacha
06/11/2017, 9:28 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Rawlings, Castro, Sankara, Ghadaffi, Zedong Hussein were all military dictators get their countries were better off during their reign

 You can't take away brutalities from Military Dictators, most criticisms are fuelled by the West
06/11/2017, 9:28 pm - Chika Nels: Cornelius is an expert in political economy 🌝
06/11/2017, 9:29 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Well true but is it relative to development.. Look at how far Libya went under Ghadaffi  Rawlings also sanitized Ghana
06/11/2017, 9:30 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Most of the Civil Organizations during the military years were sponsored by the West to stir up mayhem in their countries.
06/11/2017, 9:31 pm - Mosad: Damn!  Between you and me.  Do you think I have been too harsh on him?  He had served drinks n foods here.  🙁
06/11/2017, 9:31 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: True but did we ever have any ideological leader in Nigeria
06/11/2017, 9:32 pm - Chika Nels: Lol.. Yeah, kinda😁
06/11/2017, 9:32 pm - Mosad: We are getting things mixed up o.  There is good n bad dictatorship.  Where does Idiagbon fall into?
06/11/2017, 9:34 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: The act of being a dictator is bad in itself
06/11/2017, 9:36 pm - Mosad: <Media omitted>
06/11/2017, 9:37 pm - Mosad: If u were forced to do right.  Does that make u a dictator?
06/11/2017, 9:38 pm - Mosad: Does that make him a dictator?  The one who forced u
06/11/2017, 9:39 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Okay, let's answer the question of dictatorship
06/11/2017, 9:39 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Being a dictator doesn't make you a bad leader, it's just as a result of your unquestionable ruling
06/11/2017, 9:40 pm - Chika Nels: Hmmn
06/11/2017, 9:40 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Well the contest of true leadership doesn't give room for dictatorship..
06/11/2017, 9:40 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: *context
06/11/2017, 9:41 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: True leadership is different from true democracy
06/11/2017, 9:41 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Unquestionably ruling allow irrationality that can affect societal development
06/11/2017, 9:41 pm - Chijioke: !!!
06/11/2017, 9:41 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Democracy itself is a social experiment
06/11/2017, 9:42 pm - Chijioke: Why?
06/11/2017, 9:43 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Opinions are not regarded and most times even silenced
06/11/2017, 9:45 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Dictatorship such as Monarchy, Theocratic rule were very much traditional to Africa and Asia and they were not deemed bad till we were exposed to Democracy
06/11/2017, 9:49 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Monarchy for instance is not a form of dictatorship.. Take for example the Yoruba traditional system .. Before a king is crowned u have the Afobajes king makers who carefully following traditional prescribed procedure choose d king.. Then the king there after have wat is cabinet member who are the chiefs who together with the king administer the affairs of the people
06/11/2017, 10:01 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Not all Monarchy

There's Absolute Monarch
06/11/2017, 10:02 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: U just clarified that fact
06/11/2017, 10:05 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Yoruba's was a form of Democratic Monarchy
06/11/2017, 10:05 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: While UKs is a constitutional monarchy
06/11/2017, 10:06 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: So do we say Africans even practice democracy before they came to westernize us
06/11/2017, 10:07 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Yes
06/11/2017, 10:08 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Let have a conversation on the difference between Westernization and Modernization
06/11/2017, 10:08 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I have a book I'm writing on Ancient Yoruba Economic Thought and in my few researches, I discovered that we've experienced so much civilisation before the Westerners came
06/11/2017, 10:09 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Did colonialism bring about westernization or modernization?
06/11/2017, 10:10 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: The word civilization is s false mechanism used by the white to subjugate us
06/11/2017, 10:10 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: This depends on the view
06/11/2017, 10:10 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: French Colonies were fully westernised through policy of association
06/11/2017, 10:10 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: It was almost a pure replacement of culture and customs
06/11/2017, 10:11 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Modernisation was what happened in the America or Georgia
06/11/2017, 10:12 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Tell me more
06/11/2017, 10:14 pm - Chijioke: No
06/11/2017, 10:14 pm - Chijioke: The distinction of democracy is "voting as rights "
06/11/2017, 10:16 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Democracy evolved simply through able representatives of citizens
06/11/2017, 10:18 pm - Chijioke: Yeah but anything outside the fallacy of "right to vote", "voting as rights", "parliamentary representation" is regarded as being undemocratic
06/11/2017, 10:18 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Roman Democracy wasn't so much of voting right
06/11/2017, 10:19 pm - Chijioke: It was but wasn't extended to the entire population, even America's voting wasn't extended to Illiterates, Women and Blacks initially
06/11/2017, 10:19 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Even the ancient Igbo egalitarian society was Democratic in a sense of it
06/11/2017, 10:20 pm - Chijioke: I'm trying to explain that you aren't using the word "democratic" accurately
06/11/2017, 10:20 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Africans do vote before colonization
06/11/2017, 10:20 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Even though it wasn't structured
06/11/2017, 10:20 pm - Chijioke: It is strictly related to the perceived populist selected of leaders
06/11/2017, 10:21 pm - Chijioke: NEVER!!!!!!!!
06/11/2017, 10:21 pm - Chijioke: IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED!
06/11/2017, 10:21 pm - Chijioke: *selection
06/11/2017, 10:22 pm - Chijioke: All that existed here were Empires
06/11/2017, 10:22 pm - Chijioke: Even in the most disorganised empires like the Hausa cities they had a chieftain regarded as rulers of a certain expanse of land
06/11/2017, 10:22 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: This is the definition given to it by the Westerners to further their cultural exchange
06/11/2017, 10:22 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I will give you several instances
06/11/2017, 10:23 pm - Chijioke: We've never voted before the year 1900
06/11/2017, 10:23 pm - Chijioke: The concept of assembling at a poll is purely foreign and frankly not entirely Western
06/11/2017, 10:23 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: In Ibadan, an ancient city in the Yoruba ethnic tribe in Southwest Nigeria - there is a system for selecting their leaders which is more or less like voting
06/11/2017, 10:24 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: They are ruled by a Balogun tagged Olubadan later
06/11/2017, 10:24 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The Olubadan is elected amidst several Baloguns to lead the City
06/11/2017, 10:24 pm - Chijioke: It originated in the East(Asia and Europe) as advocacy for "Universal Suffrage"
06/11/2017, 10:25 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If assembling at the poll is what you tag voting then that definition of going is relative
06/11/2017, 10:25 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Before you become a Balogun, there are several traditional stages you've to pass through
06/11/2017, 10:25 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: And often d oldest
06/11/2017, 10:27 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The reason for the "old tag" will be explained here:
06/11/2017, 10:27 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: From being the Family Head by birth or age, to contesting for Oloritun (Street Head)
06/11/2017, 10:27 pm - Chijioke: Sorry, found no such records
06/11/2017, 10:28 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: It's still a system that's in practice
06/11/2017, 10:28 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Yh I no all dat.. Reason why ladoja is fighting the current installation of obas in Ibadan
06/11/2017, 10:28 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: He himself he is d OSI OBA of Ibadan
06/11/2017, 10:28 pm - Chijioke: In ancient Igbo land for some certain chiefs to be selected there would be a certain form of competition
06/11/2017, 10:28 pm - Chijioke: One were there would be cultural displays of ritualistic manners
06/11/2017, 10:29 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Wrestling
06/11/2017, 10:29 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: It's not a general election but a pass of mandate over several stages till one emerges as Olubadan
06/11/2017, 10:29 pm - Chijioke: At the end one would be selected by the elders we can't now call this a "democracy"
06/11/2017, 10:29 pm - Chijioke: It's one they've coined today from what was learned from Europeans
06/11/2017, 10:30 pm - Chijioke: Then it's not a democracy
06/11/2017, 10:30 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: In Ibadan, there is nothing like traditional Royal Families.

Everyone is eligible to become Olubadan once you can win the several stages to become a Balogun
06/11/2017, 10:30 pm - Chijioke: It's just that simple
06/11/2017, 10:30 pm - Chijioke: You need to understand what a democracy is before saying it is a democracy or is democratic
06/11/2017, 10:30 pm - Chijioke: That's one
06/11/2017, 10:30 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Democracy simply put should be governance selected by vast majority of people
06/11/2017, 10:31 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Here, Governance resides Absolutely in the people... They're sovereign
06/11/2017, 10:31 pm - Chijioke: Vast "recognised" majority
06/11/2017, 10:32 pm - Chijioke: Coming to play politics and make compromises in order to choose someone for an insignificant role is not a democracy o
06/11/2017, 10:32 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Please kindly explain this so as to help lighten its ambiguity
06/11/2017, 10:32 pm - Chijioke: If an individual is unrecognised by the state he isn't eligible to vote
06/11/2017, 10:33 pm - Chijioke: It was the front used by White males to prevent suffrage of women and blacks in the US
06/11/2017, 10:33 pm - Chijioke: For decades
06/11/2017, 10:33 pm - Chijioke: *pretext
06/11/2017, 10:34 pm - Chijioke: For something to be democratic, a vote that counts must be cast
06/11/2017, 10:34 pm - Chijioke: That has never happened in Africa
06/11/2017, 10:34 pm - Chijioke: At least prior to 1900
06/11/2017, 10:35 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: Awesome!
06/11/2017, 10:36 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Now that I understand the term recognised in your context, I will agree with you that no vote of such was carried out
06/11/2017, 10:36 pm - Chijioke: Exactly 👍🏽
06/11/2017, 10:37 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: But regardless, you cannot negate the democratic process of Precolonial Africa
06/11/2017, 10:37 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The various means by which individuals participate in governance
06/11/2017, 10:37 pm - Chijioke: There was none
06/11/2017, 10:37 pm - Chijioke: 🤷🏽‍♂
06/11/2017, 10:38 pm - Chijioke: It's something I've researched well
06/11/2017, 10:38 pm - Chijioke: I found no records of sucj
06/11/2017, 10:38 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Removal of leaders by democratic process

The process of checks and balances
06/11/2017, 10:38 pm - Chijioke: An agreement reached in an Igwes court or Obas palace isn't democratic
06/11/2017, 10:38 pm - Chijioke: Or democracy
06/11/2017, 10:39 pm - Chijioke: Who removed leaders by democratic process in Africa?
06/11/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The promulgation of the three arms of government
06/11/2017, 10:40 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The Ancient Yoruba had a distinct Executive, Legislative and Judiciary arms that were serving as checks and balances
06/11/2017, 10:40 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Power were somewhat vested in the people
06/11/2017, 10:40 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The popular Sango was deposed by this process
06/11/2017, 10:40 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Sango was re-installed by popular demand
06/11/2017, 10:41 pm - Chijioke: Lmao!
06/11/2017, 10:42 pm - Chijioke: Jacob Zuma is the only African President to have come close to an impeachment
06/11/2017, 10:42 pm - Chijioke: In Africa it's by a coup you will be removed!

06/11/2017, 10:42 pm - Chijioke: Democracy is against our very nature!
06/11/2017, 10:43 pm - Chijioke: We are by nature UNDEMOCRATIC!
06/11/2017, 10:43 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I think you might have to dwell more on histories, customs and traditions of the Ancient Yorubas
06/11/2017, 10:43 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: A trip to the Alaafin's palace to visit the Chief Custodian of History will surely help out
06/11/2017, 10:43 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Even Alaafin Abiodun told his subjects in distant districts to elect governors for themselves
06/11/2017, 10:44 pm - Chijioke: All this happened in the 20th and 21st century
06/11/2017, 10:44 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Have you read about Sango and his impeachment?
06/11/2017, 10:44 pm - Chijioke: As I said prior to 1900 which is the 19th century and before all this was IMPOSSIBLE!

07/11/2017, 8:38 am - Mvd Wallay: <Media omitted>
07/11/2017, 8:44 am - Mvd Wallay: Spirituality didn't emanate from religion but from ones spirit. Religion is a mundane construct not a spiritual construct.Ur religion ends here on earth, only ur spirit will go with you to d afterlife. Reduce the psychological intake of textual religious narcotics which subjected you to inebriation. Religion is politics.
07/11/2017, 8:51 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Dude Are you in my head?🤔
07/11/2017, 8:55 am - Mvd Wallay: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 truth is always identical no matter where it comes from. Truth is always harmonious. Good faith reasoning has a way of bringing good faith thinkers to harmonious convergence.
07/11/2017, 9:00 am - Chika Nels: 👌🏼👌🏼
07/11/2017, 9:03 am - Mvd Wallay: I am humbled sir
07/11/2017, 9:10 am - Chika Nels: 😅
07/11/2017, 9:13 am - Chika Nels: Big ups to The Obasan for a very insightful lecture yesterday. I definitely learnt something.
07/11/2017, 9:13 am - Chika Nels: Who else gained from the lecture?
07/11/2017, 9:28 am - Chijioke: I did
07/11/2017, 9:29 am - ‪+234 812 093 8116‬: I did!
07/11/2017, 9:29 am - Chijioke: To say that "ur spirit will go with you to d afterlife" is telling of a personal "religion" you believe in
07/11/2017, 9:30 am - Chijioke: What you may mean to say is "reduce the psychological intake of FOREIGN textual religious narcotics..."
07/11/2017, 9:30 am - Chijioke: And then I would agree
07/11/2017, 9:31 am - Chijioke: Cause you can't disapprove of religion and believe in the afterlife, it's a disconnect
07/11/2017, 9:34 am - Mvd Wallay: No. I believe every creature has a spirit. And every human is bound to make account of stewardship in a realm I am not do sure of. I know all unquestionable deeds on earth would be accounted for somewhere one way or the other. The eerie comes into question, the afterlife.
07/11/2017, 9:34 am - Mvd Wallay: Surely it is an imported consciousness.
07/11/2017, 9:35 am - Chijioke: Then that's a religion of your own making, one you believe in and worship in whatever form you find suitable
07/11/2017, 9:35 am - Chijioke: To believe in metaphysics of any form is religious!
07/11/2017, 9:37 am - Mvd Wallay: Religion is purely mundane. If God was a respecter of religion, by the virtue of religious identity, all felons would enjoy comfort in the afterlife.
07/11/2017, 9:37 am - Mvd Wallay: No it is not. When rituals are codified and enforced, it becomes a religion.
07/11/2017, 9:38 am - Mvd Wallay: No it isn't. Spirituality and religion aren't interwoven.
07/11/2017, 9:38 am - Chijioke: Ok this is definitive proof of your belief/possesion of some other form of religion
07/11/2017, 9:39 am - Chijioke: If you believe it's mundane, believe in the metaphysical, in the paranormal, as is with, the term "afterlife"
07/11/2017, 9:39 am - Chijioke: Then you have a religion
07/11/2017, 9:39 am - Mvd Wallay: No. Religion is structured , formal and imposed. Spirituality isnt
07/11/2017, 9:39 am - Chijioke: So perhaps you're not an atheist
07/11/2017, 9:40 am - Chijioke: "Everyone serves a God, whether it's money or science, it's a God"
07/11/2017, 9:40 am - Mvd Wallay: Would you call our precolonial African spirituality religion?
07/11/2017, 9:40 am - Chijioke: Yes
07/11/2017, 9:40 am - Chijioke: They were actually religion
07/11/2017, 9:40 am - Mvd Wallay: This is rhetorical
07/11/2017, 9:40 am - Chijioke: Documented
07/11/2017, 9:41 am - Mvd Wallay: No it isnt
07/11/2017, 9:41 am - Chijioke: There's still Voodoo that is still existent
07/11/2017, 9:41 am - Mvd Wallay: Not documented. Folklores aren't documented
07/11/2017, 9:42 am - Chijioke: If it's documented it's a formal religion,  and spirituality is a subset of religion
07/11/2017, 9:42 am - Mvd Wallay: That's spirituality not religion. That's why animists are referred to as spiritualist
07/11/2017, 9:42 am - Chijioke: England and France burnt several texts when they came to Africa
07/11/2017, 9:43 am - Mvd Wallay: Egypt isnt totality of the African culture
07/11/2017, 9:43 am - Chijioke: I'm actually referring to West Africa
07/11/2017, 9:43 am - Chijioke: Malian, Timbuktu texts
07/11/2017, 9:44 am - Chijioke: They did it everywhere
07/11/2017, 9:44 am - Mvd Wallay: Where in west africa?
07/11/2017, 9:44 am - Chijioke: The writings of the Zulu Empires
07/11/2017, 9:44 am - Chijioke: .
07/11/2017, 9:45 am - Mvd Wallay: Malians are magreb ignobles, not a symbol of subsahara africa
07/11/2017, 9:45 am - Mvd Wallay: Ahahahah texts written by the boers settlers
07/11/2017, 9:47 am - Chijioke: Ignoble??
07/11/2017, 9:47 am - Chijioke: The built some of the first universities in the World
07/11/2017, 9:48 am - Chijioke: And specifically Morrocans who are actual Maghreb built the first ever university in the World
07/11/2017, 9:48 am - Mvd Wallay: Yes
07/11/2017, 9:48 am - Chijioke: You are dismissing them the way a White man would
07/11/2017, 9:48 am - Mvd Wallay: They remain inferior arabs although black
07/11/2017, 9:49 am - Chijioke: Those Empires achieved far more than the Benin and Nri Kingdom combined
07/11/2017, 9:49 am - Chijioke: I don't know how you define "inferior"
07/11/2017, 9:50 am - Mvd Wallay: Alphabetic characters are purely west. Only ethiopian alphabetic characters are not.
07/11/2017, 9:50 am - Chijioke: But when you set a precedent that engulfs the World, from Islamic to African, to European and Asia-Pacific you deserve recognition
07/11/2017, 9:50 am - Mvd Wallay: British-Dutch
07/11/2017, 9:51 am - Chijioke: They say those Empires had technology as an Imperial possession not meant for the common man
07/11/2017, 9:51 am - Chijioke: I don't get
07/11/2017, 9:51 am - Chijioke: Lool
07/11/2017, 9:51 am - Mvd Wallay: Noble white and Ignoble white
07/11/2017, 9:51 am - Chijioke: I argued this sometime last week and I'll try and find records
07/11/2017, 9:53 am - Chijioke: They'll show that prior to colonisation, Egyptian, Ethiopian, Malian and Yoruba people had specific writings that are said to have largely developed independent of others
07/11/2017, 9:54 am - Chijioke: My question meant to ask, what do White people have to do with Ancient Mali/Maghrebs
07/11/2017, 9:55 am - Mvd Wallay: Can I see the yoruba alphabets? Please I dont wanna see the ABC alphabets. Unique alphabets are that of ethiopians, asians, arabs, greeks
07/11/2017, 9:56 am - Mvd Wallay: Just letting u know that thr malians might ne black but they are arabs. Arab rejects
07/11/2017, 10:00 am - Chijioke: Of course  they are Arabs
07/11/2017, 10:00 am - Chijioke: I couldn't find the docs
07/11/2017, 10:00 am - Chijioke: I thought I saved them
07/11/2017, 10:00 am - Chijioke: I know they circle around being used by ancient yoruba native doctors for forms of "calculus"
07/11/2017, 10:00 am - Chijioke: It was the calculus that caught my eye
07/11/2017, 10:01 am - Chijioke: And in the article were all sorts of writings
07/11/2017, 10:04 am - Mvd Wallay: I doubt the validity of your claim. No visual characterc of precolonial yoruba language
07/11/2017, 10:05 am - Chijioke: I know what I read pro
07/11/2017, 10:05 am - Chijioke: *b
07/11/2017, 10:05 am - Chijioke: Aside from that there are still several more
07/11/2017, 10:05 am - Chijioke: One as recent as 1900 or thereabout
07/11/2017, 10:06 am - Chijioke: Learning didn't start with Europeans so why would writing
07/11/2017, 10:08 am - Mvd Wallay: We have folklore in Africa due to the lack of alphabetic characters in precolonial era. Instead of alphabetical characters, cyphers were used by elites for communication
07/11/2017, 10:09 am - Mvd Wallay: We heard from Egypt. But Egypt isnt Africa when viewed through a radical lens
07/11/2017, 10:16 am - Chijioke: In the context of languages aren't cyphers writings?
07/11/2017, 10:19 am - Mvd Wallay: African cyphers werent alphabetic characters but objects.

However, Obasan's lecture for me reflects the trends in the African political and Socio economic realities and is fact based as well as historical. I must say that we the young people do not arm ourselves with the necessary fact to confront the future .. I may have to paraphrase Bob Marley's if you do not where you are going you should no where you coming from..

Many people who go to cast votes during the elections don't even know why they're voting, some vote for reasons you and I might call mediocre (a cup of rice or something even more unbelievable). In fact only few people actually cast their votes cause of the so-called right reasons but the electoral committee counts their votes nevertheless. Referring to my reason as invalid can be likened to a dictatorship rule.

and fire at each other and pretend to be
dead, she will mourn who she loves most".

More Details & Link to Application
In recent years, design and user-centered thinking have been embraced by business leaders–not just as a way to do design, but as a way to create an effective product development strategy. By attending this class with your cross-functional team, you will learn basic user-centered design processes and how to apply them throughout your entire product development cycle. To be eligible:
•	Please apply as a team of 4-6 people who work on a project together. All members must be able to attend 2 full days of class, from 9AM to 6PM
•	The class is geared towards startups and companies that are relatively new to the UX discipline and is not suitable for companies with UX experts with a lot of experience.
•	Space is very limited, and the application deadline is November 18.
•	If selected, your team will be required to complete a pre-workshop exercise prior to the first day of class.
Apply here: https://events.withgoogle.com/world-usability-day-ssa/ux-masterclass-lagos/#content

09/11/2017, 9:25 am - Chika Nels: Good news! On November 27 & November 28, 2 leading UX designers from Google will be conducting a 2-day hands-on user experience masterclass in Nigeria, and we'd like to invite you and your startup team to apply.

More Details & Link to Application
In recent years, design and user-centered thinking have been embraced by business leaders–not just as a way to do design, but as a way to create an effective product development strategy. By attending this class with your cross-functional team, you will learn basic user-centered design processes and how to apply them throughout your entire product development cycle. To be eligible:
•	Please apply as a team of 4-6 people who work on a project together. All members must be able to attend 2 full days of class, from 9AM to 6PM
•	The class is geared towards startups and companies that are relatively new to the UX discipline and is not suitable for companies with UX experts with a lot of experience.
•	Space is very limited, and the application deadline is November 18.
•	If selected, your team will be required to complete a pre-workshop exercise prior to the first day of class.

09/11/2017, 7:14 pm - Ede: Only UNILAG Has Full Accreditation For Law In Nigeria 

Only University of Lagos (UNILAG) has full accreditation to offer Law among public and private universities in the country.

The Council of Legal Education disclosed this in a list of accredited and approved faculties of Law in Nigeria published on Wednesday and signed its Secretary and Director of Administration of the Council.

The accreditation of three universities; Lagos State University, University of Abuja and Benue State University have been suspended.

Twenty seven others have Provisional Accreditation; five have Interim accreditation while 19 others have approval to commence.

According to the Council, Suspended Accreditation means the faculty of Law has its accreditation suspended while those with Interim accreditation are still subject to further accreditation.

The facilities of those given approval to commence still have to be subjected to further verification for Interim Accreditation status.

The Council explained that the accreditation status and approved quotas of recognized faculties was published for the benefit and guidance of the public, parents and students.

1. Make sure you have a piano
2. Ask a piano instructor for help or get ur learning materials online
3. Practice everyday for improvement 
4. Never measure your progress relative to time or relative to others 
5. Never give up, if at first you don't get it. Keep practicing
10/11/2017, 11:37 am - Neyo: 6. Record your performance once in a while
7. Do not start posting your performances on public site or social media before you reach a certain level.
8. It doesn't hurt to learn musical styles other than the one you're interested in.

10/11/2017, 1:09 pm - Chijioke: This is a selective conclusion, especially since I did explain this before: The point of africanist is simply that we need to practice our culture without outside interference, not that social consciousness necessarily emanated from the West, what ever names they've given their equivalent of this Madagascan ritual as with "HOMOSEXUALITY" is THEIR BUSINESS, we don't want to care or know about it, let's practice and celebrate our traditions without them attempting to demonize it the next minute(cause as you may know, the so called "animal rights activist" want to/have gotten bull fighting illegalized in spain), or are you now advocating their ban?
10/11/2017, 1:11 pm - Chijioke: I've said this before, you need to fully understand the *intent* of this White people before you give them support or advocate anything they say, we can't fold our arms while the maim our cultures
10/11/2017, 1:16 pm - Mvd Wallay: Not appropriating the non Africans any form of support, but simply stating the diversity of cultural values in Africa which existed prior convergence with the imperialist.
10/11/2017, 1:19 pm - Mvd Wallay: I made reference to homosexuality as a cultural ritual in a specific part of Africa. A ritual that predate colonial occupation in Africa.
10/11/2017, 1:22 pm - Mvd Wallay: We are the ones maiming  our cultural values because we are insatiable.
10/11/2017, 1:27 pm - Chijioke: No they are the ones, because they came here, kidnapped our people, forced religion on us, executed those who didn't give in to whatever ideas, came to their minds, that they decided to implement
10/11/2017, 1:27 pm - Chijioke: You are missing a large part of Africa's history
10/11/2017, 1:27 pm - Chijioke: You won't understand, until you read up on all this
10/11/2017, 1:30 pm - Chijioke: Or is our fault that the Dutch came and beheaded Badu Bonsu II in 1837,
Is it our fault that Jaja of Opogbo was poisoned on an English ship in 1891, both of them for what they called rebellion
10/11/2017, 1:31 pm - Chijioke: How can someone else be killing us and you'll say it's our fault? 🤣🤣🤣

10/11/2017, 3:09 pm - Mosad: *How did a family member shock you*
My husband. My gentle giant, big hearted, non violent, wonderful husband. As he puts it, I’m the fire and he’s the ice. I react with emotion, and cannot tolerate what I perceive as an injustice. My mouth and Mama bear actions are sometimes embarrassing for him. As we say in the south, I can be loud.

Back story: I scored tickets to see an Avett Brothers concert in Asheville, NC, their hometown on New Year’s Eve. I knew the show would be packed, and boy was it ever. Apparently the band had cancelled a show weeks earlier, and decided to honor those tickets at this concert as well. So the crowd was double the size I was counting on. We saw the long line, but decided to stick around for the show. We’d driven two hours, had gotten a hotel room and babysitter. Damn it, we were gonna have some fun come hell or high water. After an hour of waiting in the cold, we got inside, had a few drinks, and entered the floor level close to the stage.

All was great, we were singing along with the band, and the crowd was tight, but it was a happy crowd. The guy and girl in front of us were already three sheets to the wind and were dancing all over the place. They drunkenly bumped into others, but were just trying to have a good time. They bumped into me several times, and the guy turned around and yelled at me because he spilled his beer when he bumped into me. My gentleman of a husband jumped in between us and told the guy to back the fuck up off his wife. The guy then backed down. Then he was trying to leave and made the mistake of bumping into me again. He apologized, but my husband didn’t hear that part, he only saw what looked like a guy pushing his wife. In a split second he has the guy by the shirt and his fist drawn back. “I told you not to touch my wife!” I grabbed my husband and told him it was a mistake, the guy wasn’t being aggressive towards me, but simply trying to leave the situation. But the guy then just bust out sobbing hysterically and ran, girlfriend in tow. We walked outside to get some air after this and found the guy’s girlfriend outside just letting him have it. She was screaming at him, “I can’t take you anywhere without you making a scene, fuck off, I can’t be with you!”

After all this, my husband approached the guy, patted his shoulder,and said “we all came here to have a good time, this was all a misunderstanding, let’s start this over. What’s your name? Let me buy you a beer, fellow, you seem to be having a rough night.” I approached the girlfriend and asked her to forgive the guy, it was just a random dumb thing that happened. We then all shared a drink, and they left with their relationship intact.

My husband, my protector, turned a bad situation into a better night for all of us. What a fine man I married!

That shouting a person's name while they are sleeping can cause brain damage to the individual.
Instead of shouting their name, tap them gently and if the don't respond wait a bit and tap them later.
*Do not shout a person's name while they are sleeping* 
Because their adrenaline can shoot up causing fear and panic which can cause *Brain Damage*

11/11/2017, 3:58 pm - Chidera: In a recent interview the MD of Daimler Benz (Mercedes Benz) said their competitors are no longer other car companies but Tesla (obvious), Google, Apple, Amazon .

Software will disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.   

Uber is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now the biggest taxi company in the world

Airbnb is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.   

Artificial Intelligence: Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go player in the world,  10 years earlier than expected. 

In the US, young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of IBM Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for more or less basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. 

So if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% less lawyers in the future, only specialists will remain.  

Watson already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, 4 times more accurate than human nurses. Facebook now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. In 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans. 

Autonomous cars: In 2018 the first self driving cars will appear for the public. Around 2020, the complete industry will start to be disrupted. You  don't want to own a car anymore. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination. You will not need to park it, you only pay for the driven distance and can be productive while driving. Our kids will  never get a driver's licence and will never own a car. 

It will change the cities, because we will need 90-95% less cars for that. We can transform former parking spaces into parks. 1.2 million people die  each year in car accidents worldwide. We now have one accident every 60,000 miles (100,000 km), with autonomous driving that will drop to one accident in 6 million miles (10 million km). That will save a million lives each year. 

Most car companies will probably become bankrupt. Traditional car companies try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels. 

Many engineers from Volkswagen and Audi; are completely terrified of Tesla. 

Insurance companies will have massive trouble because without accidents, the insurance will become 100x cheaper. Their car insurance business model  will disappear. 

Real estate will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will move further away to live in a more beautiful neighborhood.

Electric cars will become mainstream about 2020. Cities will be less noisy because all new cars will run on electricity. Electricity will become incredibly cheap and clean: Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can now see the burgeoning impact.  

Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. Energy companies are desperately trying to limit access to the grid to prevent competition from home solar installations, but that can't last. Technology will take care of that strategy. 

With cheap electricity comes cheap and abundant water. Desalination of salt water now only needs 2kWh per cubic meter (@ 0.25 cents). We don't have  scarce water in most places, we only have scarce drinking water. Imagine what will be possible if anyone can have as much clean water as he wants, for nearly no cost.   

Health:    The Tricorder X price will be announced this year. There are companies who will build a medical device (called the "Tricorder" from Star Trek)  that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breath into it.

It then analyses 54 biomarkers that will identify nearly any disease. It will be cheap, so in a few years everyone on this planet will have access to world class medical analysis, nearly for free. Goodbye, medical establishment. 

3D printing: The price of the cheapest 3D printer came down from $18,000 to $400 within 10 years. In the same time, it became 100 times faster. All  major shoe companies have already started 3D printing shoes.

Some spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports. The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for the large amount of spare parts they used to have in the past. 

At the end of this year, new smart phones will have 3D scanning possibilities.    You can then 3D scan your feet and print your perfect shoe at home.   

In China, they already 3D printed and built a complete 6-storey office building.    By 2027, 10% of everything that's being produced will be 3D printed. 

Business opportunities: If you think of a niche you want to go in, ask yourself: "in the future, do you think we will have that?" and if the answer  is yes, how can you make that happen sooner?

If it doesn't work with your phone, forget the idea. And any idea designed for success in the 20th century is doomed to failure in the 21st century. 

Work:  70-80% of jobs will disappear in the next 20 years. There will be a lot of new jobs, but it is not clear if there will be enough new jobs in such a small time. 

Agriculture:   There will be a $100 agricultural robot in the future. Farmers in 3rd world countries can then become managers of their field instead of working all day on their fields. 

Aeroponics will need much less water. The first Petri dish produced veal, is now available and will be cheaper than cow produced veal in 2018. Right now, 30% of all agricultural surfaces is used for cows. Imagine if we don't need that space anymore. There are several startups who will bring insect protein to the market shortly. It contains more protein than meat. It will be labelled as "alternative protein source" (because most people still reject the idea of eating insects). 

There is an app called "moodies" which can already tell in which mood you're in.  By 2020 there will be apps that can tell by your facial expressions, if you are lying. Imagine a political debate where it's being displayed when they're telling the truth and when they're not. 

Bitcoin may even become the default reserve currency ... Of the world! 

Longevity:  Right now, the average life span increases by 3 months per year. Four years ago, the life span used to be 79 years, now it's 80 years. The increase itself is increasing and by 2036, there will be more than one year increase per year. So we all might live for a long long time, probably way more than 100.

Education:  The cheapest smart phones are already at $10 in Africa and Asia. By 2020, 70% of all humans will own a smart phone. That means, everyone  has the same access to world class education. 

Every child can use Khan academy for everything a child needs to learn at school in First World countries. There have already been releases of software in Indonesia and soon there will be releases in Arabic, Suaheli and Chinese this summer. I can see enormous potential if we give the English app for free, so that children in Africa and everywhere else can become fluent in English and that could happen within half a year.

11/11/2017, 5:24 pm - Ede: Why learn computer science?

There are 2 types of software engineer: those who understand computer science well enough to do challenging, innovative work, and those who just get by because they’re familiar with a few high level tools.

Both call themselves software engineers, and both tend to earn similar salaries in their early careers. But Type 1 engineers grow in to more fullfilling and well-remunerated work over time, whether that’s valuable commercial work or breakthrough open-source projects, technical leadership or high-quality individual contributions.

Type 1 engineers find ways to learn computer science in depth, whether through conventional means or by relentlessly learning throughout their careers. Type 2 engineers typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.

Currently, the number of people entering the industry is rapidly increasing, while the number of CS grads is essentially static. This oversupply of Type 2 engineers is starting to reduce their employment opportunities and keep them out of the industry’s more fulfilling work. Whether you’re striving to become a Type 1 engineer or simply looking for more job security, learning computer science is the only reliable path.

12/11/2017, 7:46 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Why we are where we are By Elisha Seyitan
The past few days and perhaps week exposed me to the various inconsistencies prevalent in our society. More appalling is the lack of innovation and waste of human resource.. Imagine boarding BRT bus and you have two people attending to you just before you have your seat. What are the two people doing ? One person gives you the ticket while another tears the ticket and at the end they get paid doing that. That is a total waste of human resource and productivity . 
I  shared this observation of mine with a friend and he argued on the basis that there are no jobs and people need to be engaged . And my point was Africa will remain the way it is if we do not understand the essence of being productive. If we keep restricting all what we do to what we can earn at the end of the month not how we can change the defective trend in our society.
Wonder why we typically have a bloated budget with more money on recurrent expenditure ? I will quote Walter Rodney who said that 'the only industry thriving in Africa is administration'. We know how to get a mass group of people doing nothing together 
 Kaduna State teachers saga have justified that. Over 2000 teachers could not pass a basic test yet they get paid prior to the revelation. Are we thinking right?
12/11/2017, 7:46 pm - Chika Nels: 👌🏼
12/11/2017, 7:46 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Two will die first....
12/11/2017, 7:47 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: For one to fall, two will most likely have a bullet lodged in his brain
12/11/2017, 7:48 pm - Chika Nels: So both will die😅
12/11/2017, 7:51 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Ya

12/11/2017, 7:51 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: 1 will eventually die
12/11/2017, 7:51 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: But 2 might escape
12/11/2017, 7:52 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: 2 I think
12/11/2017, 7:53 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Only if he jumps off the plank before one shoots
12/11/2017, 7:53 pm - Chika Nels: So what's the final answer, both or just "1"
12/11/2017, 7:54 pm - Chika Nels: No one can escape that bullet😅
12/11/2017, 7:54 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: 2 of dem
12/11/2017, 7:54 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: But 2 might be saved

So it just rolls off and rests with the other stone
12/11/2017, 9:11 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: The arched stone  also doesn't have enough force to flip the bigger stone to where B is

12/11/2017, 9:22 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Can i have another answer

First, D survives, the arched stone rolls  to the plank but because it's not as heavy as the full stone, it doesn't kill C but the bump over the lever causes the stone to project further and kill B
12/11/2017, 9:23 pm - Sammah: I was waiting for people's ans ....well noone will die
12/11/2017, 9:26 pm - Sammah: The stone at E will roll down but the arc will save D while the stone at C will stop it bcos it's not as heavy as stone C

12/11/2017, 9:44 pm - Akolab: Only C dies, the arc will save D but the ball wud have gain enough momentum to push the level down enough to kill C, though after losing this momentum its wud be lifted back up by the complete ball but C wud have been pressed by those pointy spikes below the plank

Your brand's logo should not just be a conglomeration of several shapes or types(fonts). It should be as a result of thoroughly design-thinking. 

Every decision made must have meaning or reasons behind it. Logos are not for fancy,  they help exhibit what your company or brand stands for. 

Every touch point of your business matters. Don't leave anything by chance.

Let's talk about A.I💃🏽💃🏽💃🏽
Simply put, Artificial intelligence is the making of machines/ computer systems exhibit intelligence associated with humans
Funny as it sounds, some would think computers/ machines are smarter than humans
Wrong: they have higher memory capability
Obey instructions given to them by man
They aren't lazy, they don't get tired

But all of the above does not signify intelligence
When computer systems/ machines do things without being told
Take decisions 
E.t.c that's when we say it is exhibiting intelligence 
When it is beginning to reason

15/11/2017, 12:30 pm - Akolab: I recently watched a video about machine learning which was implemented in a GO game, (FUN FACT, there are more go game formations than there are atoms in the world), so it was impossible to the write an algorithm to solve for each solutions. so the A.I (Alpha Go) learnt by playing over and over again again till if figured out its own unique configurations for players, moves that Humans havent thought of in 100 years of the Go game Inception. so my questions to you is what is Intelligence and would you consider the AI (AlphaGo ) Intelligent??
15/11/2017, 12:34 pm - Ede: IMO, the AlphaGo is intelligent.

Intelligence is ability to make inferences using previous experience. The AlphaGo learn new things from each game and uses that knowledge in successive games

Years are passing by and our kidneys are filtering the blood by removing salt and any unwanted bacteria entering our body. 

With time, salt accumulates in our kidney and it needs to undergo cleaning treatment. How are we going to do this? 

Here is an easy, cheap and simple way to do it. Take a bunch of fresh green corriander leaves ( EFO EBOLO)  and wash it clean. Cut it in small pieces and put it in a pot. Pour clean water and boil it for ten minutes and let it cool down.

Next filter it and pour it in a clean bottle and keep it in the refrigerator to cool.

Drink one glass everyday and you will notice all salt and other accumulated impurities coming out of your kidneys during urination. You will be able to notice the difference yourself!

Fresh green CORIANDER is known as the best cleaning treatment for kidneys and the best part is, it is natural!

Please share this information with others and keep your kidneys clean..

15/11/2017, 5:19 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: The most difficult time to be in a relationship as a guy is in your early twenties.

The period when you are stuck in a limbo, trying to figure out yourself and who you want to be.
At this age, you find it a herculean task asking money from your parents, considering your dad will always remind you of how he was self sufficient at your age.
So you are always left with "Nkechiyere" anyone that comes from them willingly.

To compound your "woes". You have a girlfriend whom you love so muchh, you are 24 and she is 23.
And guys being wired to want to take control, you are frustrated at your inability to take care of her like you want to.
I mean where is the money??
You are still jobless, still hustling, still finding your feet.
Still putting hands intomany things hoping plus smiles on you.

All of a sudden, she starts acting out and showing attitude.
You call, and she takes forever to pick or return your calls.
When she finally does pick, the call is like an interview session with those annoying and frustrating one word replies.
Yes, no, fine, okay, nothing.

 Then finally she ends the call with a flimsy excuse like " wait let me close the fridge", i will call you back. And the call never comes back.

Then one day she calls you and askes you "where is this relationship heading to?.
You dont even know where your own life is heading to, not to talk of a relationship.

Then she drops the bombshell. Tells you that she met a guy who wants to marry her.
And how age isnt on her side, and you are almost compelled to scream "But you are just 23". Can't you wait 3 more years let me make it.

 You just hold yourself and play the good guy
You ask her if she loves him, she dodges the question and replies you with " He treats me well".

Well since she wasn't informing you to take permission, she was simply telling you. 
You have to be the cool guy and wish her well.
One week later, she gives you the traditional wedding card. And then you do the math yourself.
She was talking to the guy a long time before now. 

Then you realise that for every "K" you got on WhatsApp, the guy was getting a long epistle.
You have been played.

Worse is you cant even blame her, you are just a prospect who no one knows what will become of your life in 4years time.
 Would you have made it or not?
She has gone for the real deal, someone who has already made it.
In footballing terms, you are a "Anthony Martial" ( prospect) while the guy is a Messi ( has made it already).
I mean you were sending her cards of N200, and the guy was telling her to manage 10k for the weekend. 
No comparison there.

And then you go through that silent heartbreak guys go through, the ones they don't talk about.
And unceremoniously you get inducted into the special hall of fame where members are young guys whose childhood loves and friends or girlfriends they thought they would end up with left them to marry someone else.
Your heart is broken into smithereens.

In this hall of fame, you are all victims. Victims of not having found your path in your early twenties.

At the wedding, no sight is more heartbreaking than seeing "the love of your life" say "I do" to this guy she just met 6 months ago.
To make matters worse, you get an alert from Diamond bank telling you how N13 have been deducted for bank charges. You are mad.
Your N4000, is down to N3987 rendering that N1k useless, you can only withdraw N3k now.
And that's your home and abroad.

Can life be more unfair at this moment?

6 years later. You are 30 now. Congratulations, you finally made it. You are as rich as you hoped you will become.
You are one of the happening guys in town.
You go to a wedding. With your friends, the men on suit. Those guys that just intimidate everyone in the hall.
You are seated scouting the hall, and the bridal train passes by.

Ofcourse, bridal train and ashoebi ladies always show themselves. That's part of the job description. Sampling.
And you spot one, she is beautiful, elegant and tall.
You walk up to her, chat her up. Exchange numbers and you leave.

She is 24, ripe for marriage. 
Three months later, you are sounding marriage to her ears. She loves how it sounds.
You are on chat with her always. 

And somewhere else, a 25year old boy still finding his way is wondering why the girlfriend is becoming distant these days.
Why is he getting those one worded replies which is unlike her.
Why do there chats seem more like interview.

And fast fast, you have proposed and simultaneously she is asking the 25year old boy that question of
 "Where is this relationship going to".... 

And then you marry her, and somewhere a boy gets heart broken...

15/11/2017, 8:28 pm - Kembele: *WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BLEACH/HYPO IS INGESTED*

Bleach is a caustic substance. That is to say that, it is corrosive and hence can cause severe burns when it is in its concentrated forn. When ingested, the liquid travels down from the mouth to the stomach. But instead of the pleasant and delicious travelling experience of a morsel of meat, or a sumptuous bite of chocolate or caramel, bleach wreaks severe havoc! 

It burns the mouth, oesophagus and even the stomach!

In fact, it is worse than acid- it melts the oesophagus just like candle melts when brought close to fire. If the volume ingested is much and the concentration of the sodium hypochlorite is high, it can melt the oesophagus so bad that it can perforate. This is a very life-threatening complication of fact ingesting hypo or bleach. 

That, Ladies, is what happens when bleach is ingested, accidentally or intentionally.

*WHY YOU MUST NOT INDUCE VOMITING OR GIVE PALM TO ANYONE WHO INGESTS HYPO/BLEACH*

The reason is very simple: when you induce vomiting in someone who has ingested *hypo*, the person's injury gets worse because, in the process of the person vomiting, the hypo will pass through the oesophagus again (for a second time) and further burn it. If the process of ingesting it didn't do sufficient damage, trust me, the process of vomiting it will do enough damage significant enough to perforate it!

Secondly, there is something called *Aspiration pneumonia*. This is pneumonia caused when a person who is vomiting, accidentally inhales some part of the vomitus or even its fumes/vapour. This is a very terrible complication of inducing vomiting in children who ingest kerosene, acid, bleach/hypo, etc. All these complications can make full recovery of that child or adult almost impossible. 

In fact, I witnessed a case of aspiration pneumonia in 2015. The poor baby didn't survive it.

Now, if giving palm oil is wrong and a dangerous move, what then can be done?


*WHAT TO DO IN A CASE OF BLEACH/HYPO POISONING*

1. Any case of bleach/hypo poisoning *MUST* be treated as an emergency! It must be taken very seriously. No jokes. Don't leave anything to chance. 

2. You must not panic. Be calm and decisive. Don't give in to panic. Panicking will only cloud your reasoning and possibly make you take a wrong decision (such as reaching for the gallon of palm oil in the kitchen).

3. If your child can talk or is old enough, calm him or her down by reassuring him/her that everything will be fine. Don't ever make them think you are helpless. You must be strong.

4. Take note of the quantity ingested (if you can), the time it was ingested and possibly carry the container of the bleach with you when going to the hospital.

5. That person or child must be taken to a hospital or health center within 1 hour of the poisoning, especially if the symptoms are getting really bad e.g the child is having difficulty with breathing, is coughing or in severe pains. 

6. If at all, as a mother, you want to do anything before you get to the hospital, rinse your child's mouth with water, give him or her some water to drink (not too much water and only if it the poisoning happened not later than 1 hour).

And....

7. *GIVE THE CHILD MILK!* Milk or ice cream helps to dilute the bleach and neutralize it. So instead of reaching for palm oil, reach for milk! And by the way, if you are still breastfeeding, just kukuma give him breast milk asap, assuming there is no artificial milk at home. 

*MILK! MILK!! MILK!!!*

*That's what you give, not palm oil!*

16/11/2017, 9:47 am - Babajide Martins: *Beware Soul Brother*

We are the men of soul
men of song we measure out
our joys and agonies
too, our long, long passion week
in paces of the dance. We have
come to know from surfeit of suffering
that even the Cross need not be
a dead end nor total loss
if we should go to it striding
the dirge of the soulful abia drums. . .
But beware soul brother
of the lures of ascension day
the day of soporific levitation
on high winds of skysong; beware
for others there will be that day
lying in wait leaden-footed, tone-deaf
passionate only for the deep entrails
of our soil; beware of the day
we head truly skyward leaving
that spoil to the long ravenous tooth
and talon of their hunger.
Our ancestors, soul brother, were wiser
than is often made out. Remember
they gave Ala, great goddess
of their earth, sovereignty too over
their arts for they understood
too well those hard-headed
men of departed dance where a man’s
foot must return whatever beauties
it may weave in air, where
it must return for safety
and renewal of strength. Take care
then, mother’s son, lest you become
a dancer disinherited in mid-dance
hanging a lame foot in air like the hen
in a strange unfamiliar compound. Pray
protect this patrimony to which
you must return when the song
is finished and the dancers disperse;
remember also your children
for they in their time will want
a place for their feet when
they come of age and the dance
of the future is born
for them.

16/11/2017, 9:58 am - Babajide Martins: take care then, mother's son,
Lest you become a dancer disinherited in mid-dance
Hanging a lame foot in the air
Like the hen in a strange unfamiliar compound

16/11/2017, 10:11 pm - Ameenah Oduola: THE KISS OF THE MARRIED WOMAN THAT EVENTUALLY SCATTERED MUGABE'S KINGDOM. A LESSON FOR ALL MEN.

Ata Ikiddeh

Now, it's difficult to piece together what is going to become of Zimbabwe after now, however history  gives us a peek at the key actors in the drama currently playing out.

Now, this is the story you dont't know.

Mugabe the deposed President of Zimbabwe, Constantine Chiwenga the Head of the Zimbabwean Military  and Mnangagwa the sacked Vice President of Zimbabwe are all friends, very good friends, they are comrades.  The three men were in their 20's when they entered the bushes and took part in the liberation struggle to free  Zimbabwe from white rule. Mugabe who was initially the Sect General of ZANU PF, became the  head of state, the other two men were equally given plum positions of power and have continued as the 3 musketeers presiding over the destiny of Zimbabwe for 37 years.

Sometime in the 90's -  Mugabe,  the first musketeer fell in love with his personal secretary who happened to be another man's wife at the time, the lady's name was Grace and she became his mistress. While Mugabe was still married Grace had children for him. In 1996 they became man and wife after the death of Mugabe's first spouse.

But Grace was no ordinary mistress turned wife, she was not ready to take a backseat, she turned herself into Mugabe's political confidant, she used the bed and made her way to the very centre of Zimbabwean politics straining the relationship between Mugabe and his two comrades.

Mnangagwa the 2nd musketeer after many years of loyalty became Mugabe's Vice President in 2014, paving the way for his eventual hold on power should Mugabe retire, resign or die. But Grace had other ideas she wangled her way into ZANU PF's politburo and began her move to take out Mnangagwa and take power from her ailing husband.

In August 2017 Mnangagwa accused certain persons in the party of trying to poison him and made references to Grace. This didn't go down well with Mugabe, how could anyone accuse his beautiful harmless  Rose flower. What Mugabe forgot was that boys are allowed to fight but the brotherhood must stay strong and united. In a move that shocked  everyone (but didn't shock his beloved Grace) , he removed Mnangagwa from the position of Vice President, Mnangagwa not sure of what Grace will do to him fled to South Africa.

Now, in comes the 3rd musketeer Chiwenga Head of the Zimbabwaean military, a friend and brother of both Mugabe and Mnangagwa, "this is all the fault of one woman", he is probably thinking  in his mind, " we were one until this woman came. I trust Mnangagwa to takeover, I don't know this woman; by the way, where was she when we were sleeping in the bushes before the liberation".

 Chiwenga sends a warning to Mugabe advising  him to put his house in order, the first time he has ever spoken this way to his senior comrade. Thinking Mugabe will take the signal, call him, negotiate and talk things over a cup of tea. NO! Mugabe does the exact opposite, he sends his Minister of Information to tell the Army General to stay out of State matters, Mugabe then finalises plans to sack Chiwenga. The military chief  at this point knows his brother and comrade in arms  has drunk deep from the strange woman's bosom, it's not him speaking anymore,  so he rolls out his tanks early this morning. He's therefore right when he says,"this is not a coup" ; when you really look at it,  3 friends have only fallen out over the ambitions of a woman.

Latest reportś say Mnangagwa the 2nd Musketeer is on his way back from South Africa, i've just seen a report he's been installed interim President.  The 1st Musketter Mugabe is under house arrest. The 3rd Musketter is in the saddle promising calm and quick elections. The 3 men have held Zimbabwe under lock and key for 37yrs, this is nothing but a change of baton. Zimbabwe needs a real revolution out of  the hands of the veterans of the liberation struggle. In the 21st century Zimbabwe is the frozen out Animal Farm in George Orwells celebrated work.

Meanwhile the woman Grace, who started the whole katakata,  I hear has fled the country leaving her beloved  husband who sacrificed everything to face an uncertain fate.

16 million Zimbabweans could not remove Mugabe  but a woman did.

Mama was always right when she always told me, "son - be careful who you fall in love with and eventually marry".

A lesson to all men.

In reply to your question
First I'm not yet an expert on this field yet ooo🙈
So I had to go and make research also👩🏽‍💻
16/11/2017, 10:19 pm - Ameenah Oduola: Data science, machine learning and expert system can all be said to be encompassed under A.I (artificial intelligence)
16/11/2017, 10:20 pm - Ameenah Oduola: The process of data science is much more focused on the technical abilities of handling any type of data.
16/11/2017, 10:21 pm - Ameenah Oduola: Where data mining can n said to be the A.I aspect
16/11/2017, 10:21 pm - Ameenah Oduola: B*
16/11/2017, 10:22 pm - Ameenah Oduola: data mining is concerned with the process. It deals with the process of discovering newer patterns in big data sets
16/11/2017, 10:22 pm - Ameenah Oduola: It applies A.I to the data
16/11/2017, 10:22 pm - Ameenah Oduola: So it's further than just data science
16/11/2017, 10:23 pm - Ameenah Oduola: It might be apparently similar to machine learning, because it categorizes algorithms. However, unlike machine learning, algorithms are only a part of data mining. However, in data mining algorithms are only combined that too as the part of a process. Unlike machine learning it does not completely focus on algorithms.

18/11/2017, 8:08 pm - Akanni Hafeez: 📚🖊
18/11/2017, 8:08 pm - Sammah: 😁😊
18/11/2017, 8:09 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Safe!
18/11/2017, 8:09 pm - Akanni Hafeez: 🤣
18/11/2017, 8:09 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: There are 2 hormones responsible for this.
1) Estrogen
2) progesterone
18/11/2017, 8:10 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: Progesterone increases after an ovary releases an egg (ovulation) at the middle of the cycle.
A drop in progesterone (along with estrogen) causes the lining to break down. This is when your period starts.
18/11/2017, 8:10 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: In other words, a missed period is caused most times by prenancy
18/11/2017, 8:11 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Egg fertilized*
18/11/2017, 8:12 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: There are variations in menstrual cycle length which are caused as a result of different factors; they include
 birth control pills, low body fat, losing a lot of weight, or being overweight. Stress or very hard exercise also can change your cycle.

18/11/2017, 8:29 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: Yes, at young age, it tends to be irregular. Then after that it can be regular. Also, towards menopause it becomes irregular again
This are due to changes in hormone leve

20/11/2017, 1:10 am - Akanni Hafeez: “
It is a naive sort of feminism that insists that women prove their ability to do all the things that men do. This is a distortion and a travesty. Men have never sought to prove that they can do all the things women do. Why subject women to purely masculine criteria? Women can and ought to be judged by the criteria of femininity, for it is in their femininity that they participate in the human race. And femininity has its limitations. So has masculinity. That is what we’ve been talking about. To do this is not to do that. To be this is not to be that. To be a woman is not to be a man. To be married is not to be single - which may mean not to have a career. To marry this man is not to marry all the others. A choice is a limitation.

21/11/2017, 7:50 am - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: *Nigerian-born Chris Imafidon is a Professor at the University of Oxford, England. Though autistic, Imafidon, whose children have been described as world’s brainiest kids, tells ‘NONYE BEN-NWANKWO, how he got to the height he has achieved*

*_You were at the University of Ilorin recently during their graduation and you said you would give a scholarship to the worst graduating student. Why?_*

You might need to ask my grandmother that because she believes that every child, without exception, has a lot to contribute to the society. She would find out what you are capable of doing. In my own generation, I try to implement what she lived by. She didn’t just preach it, she did it. She was interested in every child. I did what she would have done. She is gone now. But I am here to represent her voice. I must not let her voice be unheard in my generation, I will always echo it and my mantra is that every child is a genius. If every child is a genius, then it shouldn’t matter if you are at the top of the class, bottom or middle. The lecturers were arguing with me but I told them that they would see what these people they judged the worst students would become. I would give them scholarships and if they don’t beat the ones you say are the best students after three years, I will publicly apologise.

*_We understand you have placed such bet before…_*

Yes, David Cameron tried it with me and he lost $25m. That was what we used to build our first school in Birmingham. He said that for my child to pass the General Certificate of Secondary Education exam at the age of six, it was just the gene. I told him it didn’t have anything to do with the gene. I told him to give me the worst performing schools and I would work with the least students and he should come back nine months later. He laughed at it. But when he came back nine months later, he knew what he saw. I spoke to the children, I mentored them and I adopted them as if they were my biological children. I didn’t even teach them all the subjects, I just spoke to their personality and I used one or two subjects as samples and they were flying. In one year, they beat the best.

*_But so many people believe that smart kids are born smart and not made to be smart…_*

Shakespeare said some people are born great while others achieve greatness, and some others have greatness instilled in them; giving us a suggestion that when God makes people, He makes some one way and the others another way. God is not jobless to make some human beings with half brains. Don’t ever say somebody is useless. You are not even insulting the person, you are insulting the God that created the person.

*_But in your own case, who saw that greatness in you? Was it your mother?_*

I still tell you that everybody is smart. That is the truth. However, I remember that in my secondary school days, I remember that my Physics teacher said I could not do Physics.  I took it like that and I went home and I mentioned it to my mother.  My mother quickly called her mum – my grandmother and they went to the school. They almost beat up the Physics teacher. He even had to beg me that if he said anything I didn’t like, I shouldn’t tell them at home.

*_Your parents would have loved you so much…_*

Yes, my mother had a son that died before he was two years. After that, she had another son that also died. So when I came, they used to drive flies away from me. They never allowed anything to touch me even when I was a baby. My father was the only son of his mother. To carry the family name, you must have a son and you protect the son. So anything I did was monitored by my parents and grandparents. All my friends that used to play with me, because of their parental input, scored lower than me. I ended up being different. So if every parent would believe that his child would achieve, that child would indeed achieve. We just need to work out the formula that would make that child achieve what you want him to.

*_So your mother or grandmother had a formula for you too?_*

Yes, mine was football and my mother knew I liked football. But then, whenever she saw me with football, she would take it away from me. She would say I wasn’t working hard enough. But my grandmother would buy me another football and say she would give it to me provided I came first in the class. In fact, I would say my grandmother is the professor and not me. She did all the work to ensure that I am what I am today. If not that she kept ‘bribing’ me to do this and that, I would have just done anything I wanted. So when you saw me working hard to pass an exam, it was mainly because of the football I was promised. I remember a day in my secondary school that I was given my report card, I didn’t go home, I went straight to my grandmother’s house and I gave her the report card. She cooked special food and after that, even while still wearing my uniform, I took the ball she had bought for me and went to the field to play. I played football till it was dark. Remember I hadn’t gone home then, so my parents were looking for me. Later, my father heard I was somewhere playing football. He was angry with my elder sister for allowing me to play football. My father caught hold of me and asked me for my result. I told him I took the first position and he said I made it up. I told him to ask my grandmother. He went to my grandmother and asked her and she told him she gave me the ball because I took the first position in school. He asked her why she didn’t tell him and she said, ‘you, how many times did you ever come first in school?’ So that is the story of my so-called intelligence. It wasn’t based on the love of school, it was based on the fact that I would gain something if I did well.

*_But did you know that your children would ever become world’s smartest kids?_*

I don’t think they are the world’s smartest kids.

*_But that is what they are known as; they are even in the Guinness book of records…_*

It was because British Broadcasting Corporation keeps a record every year during the day the result is announced. There is a programme that BBC runs, CNN later joined them. They usually showcase the best students in that year. So, the first year, Ann Marie, my first daughter passed GCSE exam while she was in primary school. She was the youngest schoolgirl in that year. They had to feature her and interview her. The next year, her younger sister passed the same exam even at a younger age. She was nine then. Then the media said nobody had ever had two siblings from the same family getting that position. Then, Samantha, my third daughter came and wrote that same exam at the age of six and even doubled what they scored. So they just believed that it is in their gene for them to do that well. That was when they started saying those rubbish and calling them world’s smartest kids.

*_But how could a six-year-old pass GCSE exam?_*

She didn’t read any book.  She just played games. You don’t need to read any book to play ‘ayo’.  She understood big concepts just by playing ‘ayo’. It is funny that they are called the brainiest. They are not. They are just a people that consistently performed well. And to show that they are not the brainiest, I told the BBCwhen they were interviewing me to give me the area with the worst school result and they gave me Hackney. I looked for the worst schools there and that was how I started getting students who are not biologically linked to me and we applied the same concepts and they passed very well.

*_How did you get to know the Queen of England?_*

I don’t know if the story is true but I was told that the Queen’s granddaughter told her that the GCSE exam was so hard and the next morning when the Queen was reading the newspaper, she read about a little girl that had passed the exam at primary school. This was the exam that her 17-year-old granddaughter said it was hard. She was marvelled! She asked how it happened and they told her that my child was a genius and we could also have used African voodoo. She then told them to go and look for me. I didn’t know who the Queen was then. I only knew she is a powerful woman whose picture is on the currency. I never knew she could like me because I was following what my grandmother said I should do. She gave us an award and she became interested in knowing how we were able to do what everybody found so difficult. That was how our royal journey started. But it is not difficult to pass; you only have to know the steps.

*_What are the steps?_*

Just know the limit of your mentality. You have to have a mentality that you can do something. Then you have to have a mentor. The mentor would help you construct the next step, which is the module that you would follow. Then you have to have a modality.

*_Why did you migrate to the United Kingdom by the way?_*

What I wanted to study was not available here and in Africa, I had to go to the UK for it.

*_What’s the course?_*

It’s a postgraduate qualification in a specialised aspect of ophthalmology. I wouldn’t want to bore you with it. But the essence is that you will be able to wear contact lenses in the normal eyes and you don’t have infections and inflammations or redness.  I had to study it either in the US or the UK. My options were limited. I did my first degree in Nigeria. The career path in Nigeria is traditionally British. The country went gaga and changed everything to American. But then, it didn’t play any role in what eventually became of me. What became of me was learning to learn. As such, I get irritated when people tie themselves to one profession or one job.

*_Nobody would know you were autistic…_*

I was autistic!



*_Were you stigmatised as a child back then?_*

Of course. I was teased and taunted by my colleagues and friends. People would always pick on you. People would always laugh at you. One of the signs of an autistic person is stammering. The society will laugh at you. If you have good parents, they will reassure you and protect you. I never allowed such to stop me. My grandmother made sure of that.

*_You must have also taught your kids a lot…_*

Buy your kids toy instruments. Let them ruin them if they must. It sounds very expensive anyway but you are teaching the child more than any book because the child is doing it and knowing it and fixing it. My children ruined a lot of my computers when they were growing up. I was so annoyed. But they turned out well. That is why my girl had to get me an iPad when she started working. She tried to compensate me for all the devices they ruined.  But all that they ruined made them understand the internal workings of the devices. When she went to school, the school computer crashed. The head teacher’s PA called the technical support team to come and fix it. My daughter came in, saw the screen with the error message and said she could fix it since it was the same message that was on the one she fixed at home. She was able to fix it instantly and it started working. When the engineer came, they told him a little girl had fixed it. He insisted on seeing my daughter. She told him what she did to the computer and the man opened his wallet and gave her 20 pounds! She was seven years then. The man looked at the head teacher and other staff members and told them if they had problems with their computers, they should call my daughter first before calling him. That was what changed her entire life. She did Information and Communications Technology exam when she was in primary school. She built the website for the school when she was still in primary school. The website won multiple awards. She became the technical director of the school. Why am I saying all these? As parents, we are very careful with all our devices. We don’t even allow our kids to touch our phones. Allow them! Sometimes, they would even be able to restore and repair it. You don’t know where they will be exposed to tomorrow. Every child is a genius. That is what I believe in.

*_Could that be why you decided to work with the Child Dignity Foundation?_*

The society said autism is a disease but autism is a gift. If you think it is a disease, then you cure it. If you see it as a gift, you have to celebrate it and it will replicate. When I heard what the Executive Director of CDF, Amaka Awogu, is doing with autistic kids and those who have Down Syndrome, I decided to key into it. It is irritating to me that we treat autistic people as less than human. We even classify them as disabled. I am challenging the mainstream and I say that I will work with autistic kids and at the end of nine months, if they don’t beat your best, then I will apologise publicly. I know what an autistic child is about. I didn’t read it; I know what it is about.

*_Did you ever know you would get to this level back then?_*

How could I have known? Who would have told me?

*_How is life in the UK? Is there any form of segregation even now that the world is developed?_*

There is no racism. I can tell you clearly. Anytime they see talent, they forget about your colour. They come here to look for (Nwankwo) Kanu to come and play football for Arsenal. He is not from London, so why did they give him that opportunity to play for them and they paid him millions of pounds even more than the Arsenal boys who were there before him? Talent lifts you above geographical boundaries or even racial boundaries. I am not supposed to have access to the Queen but a goldfish has no hiding place. The Queen read how the kids were doing in school and requested to see me. She said we have 35 per cent pass rate in Maths in England and this man is making primary school children to pass Maths, is it voodoo? My children received royal awards.

*_Your children passed secondary school exams in primary school, how then did they further their education?_*

My son and daughter passed secondary school exam and the school board had to meet and they asked themselves what they would do. There was no question paper in that primary school that they couldn’t pass.  So they had to vote an amount for them and so, every Wednesday, the head teacher would put them in her car and drive them to a secondary school so that they could join them to do Maths that is appropriate to their level. My younger daughter, Samantha, had to even do double Maths at the age of six. It hadn’t happened anywhere on the planet before her. I am telling this story because I want to let you know that your talent can trump your race, gender, country or anything because it is a competitive world. We blew Guinness books of records. You will not hear so much about Christiana in the press because she is too busy. At 11, she got a scholarship from the national government to go to a university. It is official. You can check it out at the University of Cambridge website. She studied Mathematics and Statistics. At 14, HSBC gave her a place in the bank and after two weeks, they gave her a credit card. Remember she wasn’t entitled to a credit card at that age. After a month, they said she should go to the stock exchange.

*_In all you do, do you even get tired?_*

Why? This is my hobby! You don’t get tired of doing what you love. You don’t retire from your hobby, you retire from a job. Your job is the profession you do every day to earn a living. I do what I love and I love what I do. I will keep working and working until I expire. Every single human being is a genius and I would want to open that greatness so that everybody would see it.

*_For 30 years, you did not return home since you left for England, why?_*

I wasn’t even supposed to be here now. The first person that invited me to come to Africa was Nelson Mandela. He read about us in the newspaper and he wept like a baby. They had told Mandela that when God was giving IQ, he only gave it to white people and gave the remnant to black people. So when he saw it on TV that a black person defeated a white person in intellectualism, he was thrilled. It’s so painful that he died before we could go there. He didn’t just want me to come; he had wanted the whole family to come when he heard about our story.

*_Did your grandmother live to see what you eventually became?_*

That is why I am sad. She didn’t live enough to see my children. I would have loved for her to have seen the fruit of what she planted. She told me how the educational system suppressed the women in her time. I was pampered by my grandmother.

28/11/2017, 6:44 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Personally, I believe the sole purpose of starting a business is to make profit. Have you even done a market survey? I can see someone there talking about "just starting a business "... There's nothing like "just " when starting a business... Technical know how? "forget school"... I just hope this is not going to be another case of failed investment. My little advice, call the girls in question and ask what interests them and what they feel they can sell... Poultry even sells better than the above mentioned business ideas... Be creative, don't go and hook your money somewhere and expect returns

*Yes 100% it can happen........*
*📸 This is a true incident, which happened with a 21 year old boy studying engineering. He died in Keshwani hospital. He was admitted in the hospital in burned conditions.*

*📸 The reason........?*

*He went to Amrawati for study tour, while coming back, he was waiting for a train at the railway station along with his friends.* 
*Many of them were taking group photo with  their mobiles with digital camera.*

*📸 This boy was also there and trying to take group photo. The place where he was standing, complete group photo was not coming, so to get complete group photo he went a little back.*

*📸 The place where he was standing, there was a electric wire with 40,000 volt. As soon as he pressed the button of digital camera, the electricity of 40,000 volt entered the camera through the flash and then the fingers and the whole body.*

*📸 All this happened in a fraction of few seconds and  50% of his body was burnt, later on he died.*

*📸 This can happen with anyone as we all are using mobile.*
*Are we learned and responsible?*

*📱 Avoid using mobile phones at petrol pumps.*

*📱 Avoid using mobile phones when u're driving.*

*📱 "When mobile is on charging don't receive call", 1st remove the charging pin and then receive the call.*

*📱 "When mobile is on charge don't put it on bed or wooden furniture".*

*📱 Pls don't use mobile phone/digital camera -flash at railway stations or any other place, where there is a 'heavy electricity wire'.*

*📱Don't use mobile phones where there is high electromagnetic waves or near electricity  transformers etc.*

*📱Don't use mobile phone in the rain during lightning and thunder and if you must stay far away from windows and doors.*

*This is for your safety....*

*After reading pls share it, because you might save a life by sharing this information. Pls share with all ur contacts...*

*"Don't just read, but remember to always follow instructions".*

29/11/2017, 2:17 pm - Chijioke: That would be a lovely invention though
29/11/2017, 2:18 pm - Chijioke: The 40k volts wouldn't need to pass through light to get to him, such a high voltage would suppress pressure that prevents electricity from traveling through air
29/11/2017, 2:19 pm - Chijioke: In short 40k volts can very very easily be transmitted through air, over short distances

29/11/2017, 3:27 pm - Chijioke: So that you'll see it fall and act
29/11/2017, 3:28 pm - Chijioke: Of course
29/11/2017, 3:28 pm - Chijioke: It's a bubble
29/11/2017, 3:28 pm - Chijioke: In my view, with the way bitcoin is 
1. unregulated, 
2. characterized by pump and dump schemes and scams, 
3. volatility
*4. predominance of libetarianism, near entire lack of socialism*
5. no particular community guiding principles to protect people's money

It will eventually crash, the hottest point is in bold, if there's one thing we learnt during the Great Recession and Great Depression is that Libertarians and Laissez-faire Capitalist who always advocate *"free market principles"* and *"non-interventionist governments"* have a hubby of running everything into the ground for profits then they run back to the governments they wanted freedom from, for protection

02/12/2017, 12:51 pm - Akolab: Dear all,
You would have noticed recently that the heat during the day and night have been unbearably high. This is as a result of heat waves stemming from the emission of greenhouse gases. The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) has warned Nigerians to prepare for more hot days and warm nights. This preparation will require smart adaptation strategies and engaging in climate resilient practices to cope with the damage that has been done.
The common effects of heat waves on humans are dehydration which can lead to fainting or death, chickenpox, heat rash, and psychological stress.
In order to cope with the current climate conditions, experts have advised that we
  Should drink more water to keep hydrated. Keep a water bottle with you to remind you to take water. Avoid alcoholic and caffeinated drinks during this period.
 Reduce intake of foods that are rich in protein because they increase metabolic heat. Fresh foods, fruits and vegetables are better options.
  Monitor your blood pressure
Should, as much as possible, stay indoors between 12noon and 3pm
 Should take cold baths before going to bed at night
Please endeavor to adhere, we need you hale and hearty! Stay blessed....

NIGERIAN BANKS O
@mascotisdeadly

*U.B.A:*
That bank looks like a shrine.. Everywhere is just painted Red! And the bank is very stingy, they will never employ workers. It’s only UBA you will enter & see empty cashier seats… They will be up to like 2 employed but there will be only 1 Cashier who ends up delaying customers.

*GTB:*
This bank has the highest number of customers! The only bank that looks like aba ariaria market. U queue like mofedaku. The only difference is that you see people with suits and pen, they have their wahala but I like them shaa

*Skye Bank:*
Hian! This bank will just be looking like somebody’s bathroom. Very small bank, dem go jampack people like sardines! Their workers no dey even wear suit again probably because of heat… Everybody dey enter the bank with hand fan

*Diamond Bank:*
Only their Lemon Green Colour can make you open 18 accounts with them even if nothing is inside. That is the only thing good about them. They have few branches in cities, their banking hall is like onitsha main market place. But their transfer protocol be like American constitution, simple to transfer with ATM, u go first go sign Non disclosure agreement.

*Zenith bank:*
This one ehn…? The only thing dem know how to do best is to decorate their walls with mirrors. You will just stay at the front and be seeing someone behind you? Sometimes if you enter the bank, you will be confused, you won’t even know which road to follow because everybody is appearing two two for the mirror. I wonder if their CEO is a Crystal palace fan. Just carry crystal glass full everywhere!

*Sterling Bank*
Where do I start from, hmmm this bank looks like eatery, atimes I used to mistake it for where they are selling ice creams, ices and sharwama

*Union Bank:*
Chai! This bank ehn? I cannot fit yab dem because dem old pass my grandpapa!?
Sometimes, I begin to think maybe the children of Israelites have accounts with Union bank… Their security men sef na old old old papas dem be…. You go enter bank to pay na people with walking stick u go dey see ..

*FCMB*
They are just beautiful women with good attitudes only that all your incomes will just be going for aso ebi and ice cream

*FIDELITY*
That one na bank for retired teacher, the only issue in customer care na about pension, u reach cashier point, one old papa will be withdrawing #45,675, #5 naira will always appear. I wonder if no be that bank dey hold all #5 CBN prints. Infact, they are the only bank whose ATM has pension button.

*FIRST BANK.*
Ah ah ah, this bank can annoy somebody, their first wahala na their door, they will just be screening u like say na jamb office. If you enter nko, queue be like Aba road hold up for port Harcourt, Infact the most annoying tin is some of their workers behaviour, somebody will just be counting #7,000 with machine and #200,000 with ordinary hand. They can screen #1000 like keke people but the good thing about them is their ATM galleries. For that one them try.

*Wema Bank*
that one na fishermen and panel beaters dey go there recently.

*UNITY BANK:*
Make them just return their name back to BANK OF THE NORTH. Because how person go wan enter bank e go come be like say u dey enter Zaria city gate. , everywhere they smell Turare (perfume) even the cashiers speak Hausa with u because u wear Agbada.

*Keystone Bank.*
This bank looks like they are always on strike. The banking hall looks like they only attend to one customer at a time.

*Heritage Bank:*
that one looks like PDP Secretariat after 2015 election. Even their flag is worn out

*Ecobank.*
That one looks like NaijaBet office. Its always jam packed on Fridays only. With lots of branches and many people that speaks amny African languages especially in Lagos branch
Sometime I suspect that bank has something to do with Arsenal FC

*Access bank:*
Na shakara dey worry them. Their account opening process be like application for Canadian visa.

*Stanbic IBTC*
The bank suppose to relocate back to south Africa. Everybody dey speak through their nose seff.

CBN...
I wont say it....You want EFCC to investigate me abii?

02/12/2017, 9:36 pm - Chika Nels: Pls, I didn't get nada from the vns..and I'm using a headset🤦🏽‍♂
02/12/2017, 9:37 pm - Tosin Lawal: What is Games Theory? 
It is the formal study of decision making where a player or several players must make choices that potentially affects their interests and the interests of other players
02/12/2017, 9:40 pm - Tosin Lawal: The concept of Games Theory provides a language to formulate, structure analyze and understand strategic scenarios
02/12/2017, 9:41 pm - Tosin Lawal: To formulate and structure means to formally model a situation which involves lising the players and their strategic options
02/12/2017, 9:42 pm - Tosin Lawal: Analyzing involves understanding their preferences and their reactions to strategic scenarios
02/12/2017, 9:43 pm - Tosin Lawal: Forget all the be I'm writing
All I'm saying is Games theory as a whole helps to create a clearer view of a situation so you can make the best decision in that situation.  Kapish??
02/12/2017, 9:44 pm - Tosin Lawal: Sorry about my voice
It's not in the best state so we do messages instead
02/12/2017, 9:45 pm - Tosin Lawal: Before I proceed, I'd like to define some terms I'd use or I already used even
02/12/2017, 9:46 pm - Tosin Lawal: Every game must have a player yea
In GT, a player is mostly referred to as an agent 
He's the one that makes decisions in a game
02/12/2017, 9:46 pm - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
02/12/2017, 9:48 pm - Tosin Lawal: The actions made in a game are called *Strategies*
02/12/2017, 9:49 pm - Chika Nels: 👌🏼👌🏼
02/12/2017, 9:49 pm - Tosin Lawal: Now, result you get from making a strategy in a game is referred to as the *Payoff* of the strategy
02/12/2017, 9:50 pm - Tosin Lawal: All these are quite easy to understand but if what I'm writing doesn't make sense, please just tell me biko
02/12/2017, 9:52 pm - Tosin Lawal: For example, killing an enemy in COD
Killing is the strategy you adopted, you could have easily gone stealth mode and left the enemy 
Your payoff would be that you stay alive
02/12/2017, 9:53 pm - Tosin Lawal: Except in the killing strategy might result to your cover being blown which isn't the best payoff 
But in the other, you still stay hidden 
Strategies and Payoffs are important concepts in GT
02/12/2017, 9:54 pm - Tosin Lawal: Except the*
02/12/2017, 9:54 pm - Tosin Lawal: Moving on..
02/12/2017, 9:55 pm - Tosin Lawal: Strategies can be classified into 2 types
Dominated strategy and dominating strategy
02/12/2017, 9:55 pm - Tosin Lawal: I'm very sure they explain themselves already
02/12/2017, 9:56 pm - Tosin Lawal: One dominates the other and one is dominated 
And it dominates because it gives a better payoff to the player (regardless of what the other players of the game played)
02/12/2017, 9:57 pm - Tosin Lawal: What I put in bracket is actually very important
02/12/2017, 9:57 pm - Tosin Lawal: We'd see later
02/12/2017, 9:58 pm - Tosin Lawal: But for now, we can say the staying in stealth mode is the dominating strategy and killing the enemy is the dominated strategy
02/12/2017, 10:00 pm - Tosin Lawal: Common knowledge in GT is a fact that all players know and they all know that they know it
Using the COD example 
The common knowledge could be the fact that they know they are at war and they all have weapons and won't hesitate to kill themselves
02/12/2017, 10:03 pm - Tosin Lawal: There are other terms sha 
Might not be needing them this night
02/12/2017, 10:04 pm - Tosin Lawal: An important classification of Games is based on how they're described 
We have the Cooperative game and the Non-Cooperative game
02/12/2017, 10:06 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: 📝📝📝
02/12/2017, 10:06 pm - Babajide Martins: 👌🏿👌🏿
02/12/2017, 10:07 pm - Chika Nels: 📝
02/12/2017, 10:07 pm - Tosin Lawal: For the cooperative game, like the name implies, agents cooperate and play against themselves to achieve a goal 
In this type of game, the model doesn't deal with offers and counter offers made in the game, the only focus is the outcome of the game itself
02/12/2017, 10:09 pm - Tosin Lawal: For example, PDP and APC cooperating in the Senate to take pass a bill that KOWA party and APP are trying to pass because it doesn't benefit them
02/12/2017, 10:11 pm - Tosin Lawal: But in Non-cooperative games, every strategic decision made and the times when they were made are crucial in determining the outcome of the game
02/12/2017, 10:13 pm - Tosin Lawal: E.G
Samsung and IPhone looking for ways to make the best sales in a year
The decision to hold or release, the decision to wait a little longer or accelerate production process, the decision to beat each other to market all determines who comes out on top
02/12/2017, 10:13 pm - Tosin Lawal: Any question to far???
02/12/2017, 10:15 pm - Tosin Lawal: Abi you people are not even enjoying it cos you're not hearing my sweet voice 🙄🙄
02/12/2017, 10:15 pm - Babajide Martins: Is there any way knowingly or unknowingly these "scheme-like" attitude was applied in game of thrones by any of its characters
02/12/2017, 10:16 pm - Tosin Lawal: Lool.. Mofo
02/12/2017, 10:16 pm - Tosin Lawal: I'm sure it was used
02/12/2017, 10:16 pm - Babajide Martins: Hmmm
02/12/2017, 10:17 pm - Tosin Lawal: One thing we need to realise is that every body makes decisions and uses GT in a way without even knowing
02/12/2017, 10:17 pm - Tosin Lawal: It's probably done in its simplest form
02/12/2017, 10:19 pm - Tosin Lawal: You go to the market, you identify the guy that looks like he hasn't made much sales and is probably desperate to make one at that moment 
You go to him and because you're holding the cards at that time, you give him one shitty price that he might just give in and say "bring money beebee"
02/12/2017, 10:19 pm - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: Until you become controversial you might never be influential
02/12/2017, 10:19 pm - Tosin Lawal: It's just GT under the scenes without you even knowing
02/12/2017, 10:21 pm - Tosin Lawal: Now when it becomes really big is when you represent it with mathematics 
At that point, manipulation becomes clearer and easier 
You now have a sweet picture of what is going on under the scenes 
In that moment, you realise how much power you have
02/12/2017, 10:23 pm - Tosin Lawal: Moving on
02/12/2017, 10:23 pm - Tosin Lawal: Hopefully the interesting part
02/12/2017, 10:24 pm - Tosin Lawal: I want to explain dominance well
02/12/2017, 10:24 pm - Chika Nels: Cool
02/12/2017, 10:25 pm - Tosin Lawal: *Remember this*
One dominates the other and one is dominated 
And it dominates because it gives a better payoff to the player (regardless of what the other players of the game played)
02/12/2017, 10:26 pm - Tosin Lawal: To explain games theory, there's one simple example that almost everybody knows about
02/12/2017, 10:26 pm - Tosin Lawal: *The Prisoner's Dilemma*
02/12/2017, 10:28 pm - Tosin Lawal: The prisoner's dilemma is a classic case that would explain the term dominance term in the simplest form
02/12/2017, 10:29 pm - Tosin Lawal: Now, we have 2 guys that have committed a crime and the police doesn't have any evidence against them but still, they've been arrested and put in separate cells
02/12/2017, 10:29 pm - Tosin Lawal: These 2 guys have 2 strategies they should choose from
02/12/2017, 10:33 pm - Chika Nels: 😍🕺🏽
02/12/2017, 10:33 pm - Tosin Lawal: To either cooperate with themselves and not say anything  to the popo or defect and give the popo the confession they need to prosecute both of them
02/12/2017, 10:34 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Hmm...
02/12/2017, 10:34 pm - Tosin Lawal: For player 1
Strategy C for cooperate 
Strategy D for defect
02/12/2017, 10:34 pm - Chika Nels: Meanwhile they are in separate rooms and don't know what the other might do
02/12/2017, 10:35 pm - Tosin Lawal: For player 1
Strategy c for cooperate 
Strategy d for defect
02/12/2017, 10:35 pm - Tosin Lawal: Yeah.. They are in separate cells and don't know the decision the other might make
02/12/2017, 10:36 pm - Tosin Lawal: For player 2.. Sorry
02/12/2017, 10:37 pm - Tosin Lawal: <Media omitted>
02/12/2017, 10:39 pm - Tosin Lawal: Pay off 3 means the prisoner gets immunity 
Pay off 2 means the prisoner gets a brief sentence maybe 6months
Pay off 1 means they get sentenced too but maybe for like 3yrs
Pay off 0 means a very long sentence like life imprisonment
02/12/2017, 10:40 pm - Tosin Lawal: The box is divided into 4 boxes
02/12/2017, 10:41 pm - Tosin Lawal: Top left box has the strategies (C, c) that is 1st prisoner cooperates and doesn't say shit, the 2nd prisoner cooperates and doesn't say shit too
02/12/2017, 10:43 pm - Tosin Lawal: Top-right box has the strategies (C, d) 
The 1st prisoner cooperates, the 2nd doesn't and spills like a pussy
02/12/2017, 10:45 pm - Tosin Lawal: Bottom left (D, c) 
Player one defects and player 2 still cooperates
02/12/2017, 10:45 pm - Tosin Lawal: Last box (D, d) 
They both spill to the police men
02/12/2017, 10:46 pm - Tosin Lawal: At this point, even if they both agreed to not say a word, there's still a possibility that the other would spill
02/12/2017, 10:47 pm - Tosin Lawal: BTW.. I was supposed to say something about rationality of a player in Games theory
02/12/2017, 10:48 pm - Tosin Lawal: A player is said to be rational if he plays in a manner that maximizes his own payoff
02/12/2017, 10:49 pm - Tosin Lawal: In this dilemma, the rational player would want to safe guard himself and not leave his faith in the hands of some other player
02/12/2017, 10:52 pm - Tosin Lawal: C, c gives them both 6 months sentencing 
C, d gives player1 life imprisonment and player 2 immunity
02/12/2017, 10:53 pm - Tosin Lawal: Also D, c gives player1 immunity and player 2 life imprisonment
02/12/2017, 10:53 pm - Tosin Lawal: And D, d gives them both like 3yrs sentencing
02/12/2017, 10:56 pm - Tosin Lawal: At this point, you'd think it's best to keep shut and cooperate 
But this strategy doesn't put you in control
The outcome is now dependent on the other player, in other words, you lose power 
You could either just get 6 months at best or life at worst depending on what the other prisoner does
02/12/2017, 10:57 pm - Tosin Lawal: But looking at the defect strategy, you spill
You're definitely not getting life imprisonment (0payoff) 
You could even get immunity from the crime(payoff of 3)
02/12/2017, 10:57 pm - Tosin Lawal: Or just get 3yrs imprisonment (payoff of 1)
02/12/2017, 10:58 pm - Tosin Lawal: The rational thing a player would do is to defect
02/12/2017, 10:59 pm - Tosin Lawal: He knows that what ever the outcome the other player makes, his payoff can never be 0 so he's not getting life
02/12/2017, 10:59 pm - Tosin Lawal: This defect strategy is said to be the dominating strategy of this game
02/12/2017, 11:00 pm - Tosin Lawal: Regardless of what the other prisoner does, he's still getting something out of the whole situation
02/12/2017, 11:03 pm - Tosin Lawal: There are many other scenarios where games theory can be used
02/12/2017, 11:05 pm - Tosin Lawal: In the analysis of stock markets, knowing when to buy and sell cryptos, in auctions to know when to fold or bid, etc
02/12/2017, 11:07 pm - Tosin Lawal: Also GT can help us to create an automated system that would serve as a decision maker 
Systems like these are always very efficient because they provide the best decisions you should make given that every player in the game is a rational one
02/12/2017, 11:08 pm - Tosin Lawal: The application cannot be over emphasized, cos it is one very powerful tool for decision making
02/12/2017, 11:09 pm - Tosin Lawal: And life is full of choices where we'd have to make decisions at every point we encounter choices
02/12/2017, 11:11 pm - Tosin Lawal: This is probably more of an enlightening talk than a lecture I know but I hope I have done something worthwhile
Atleast games theory is not alien topic to us again
02/12/2017, 11:12 pm - Tosin Lawal: Thank you for reading my plenty bullshit that's if you read sha 
And I'm sorry I didn't drop vns.. Voice ish

04/12/2017, 8:06 am - Ede: Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. Marissa Mayer (then Yahoo boss) spent $1.1 billion on Tumblr in 2013. Instagram had a clear mission: take photo-sharing mobile. Tumblr's mission was not very clear as a microblogging and social media ecosystem. Largely, in a world of Wordpress, the mission of Tumblr was clouded. While Instagram went and became a category-king in its category, there was already a king before Yahoo bought Tumblr. It did not take long for Yahoo to write-off two-thirds of the Tumblr purchase price. David Karp, the founder of Tumblr is leaving Yahoo.

The best startups are those with missions. And great investors are those that identify companies with clear missions. It is not just enough to be busy; you must find a space and have a clear mission.

The whole constructs of scalable advantage will never happen for companies without clear missions. To scale, markets must believe and accept you. It is not about technology, it is about finding a clear way to fix a friction that exists in a market. Finding a way for people to share photos on mobile was evolving then, but being another platform to blog when you cannot even use proper grammar for your name is a lost one.

Step back today and ask yourself: what is the mission of my startup? If that mission is not clear enough, you will struggle to communicate why markets will accept you. Ms Mayer did not bother on understanding what Tumblr was pursuing because its substitutes were everywhere. It never had a chance of ever being the king. That is not a smart way to invest money.

04/12/2017, 5:35 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: Jack Ma, the richest man in China said:

If you put Bananas and Money
in front of Monkeys, monkeys will choose Bananas because monkeys
do not know that money can buy a lot of Bananas.
IN REALITY, if you offer JOB and BUSINESS to people, they would choose JOB because most people do not know that BUSINESS can bring more MONEY than wages.

Similarly, Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best selling book "RICH DAD, POOR DAD" and also a business partner of Donald Trump said:
"One of the reasons poor are poor, is because poor people are NOT TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE ENTREPRENEUR-SHIP OPPORTUNITIES.
They spend too much time in school and what they have learnt in school, is to WORK FOR WAGES instead of MONEY WORKING FOR THEM.
"Profit is better than wages, for wages can make you a living but profits can bring you a fortune."
THINK INVESTMENT!!

04/12/2017, 10:19 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: I hate them too. I call them corporate thieves. 
Banking system is like when you keep your money with me to trade or do whatever I want with it to make money for myself. Now you'll have to come to me anytime you need your money, then I'll give you different excuses to make you pay for wanting to take from your money.
04/12/2017, 10:19 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: I'm sorry ma'am

04/12/2017, 10:20 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: I think we should stop making the idea of working for someone seem like a curse... It has brought more problems
04/12/2017, 10:20 pm - Chika Nels: 😆😆
People that are hiding in regret 😅
04/12/2017, 10:20 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Technology would face many of them out soonest 😂

04/12/2017, 10:21 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: 😁😁😁 I've always known that there's no greater motivation greater than self motivation. I have never fallen for them because I believe you can't preach success when you're not successful. Some of them haven't achieved what they're telling you you can do.
04/12/2017, 10:23 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Exactly... My opinion... Dangote and co should be giving me lectures on how to be successful... Not someone who will finish lecturing me and struggle with me for the last seat in the bus going to Bariga... Ra ra o
04/12/2017, 10:24 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: Those ones are in a modern slave trade. They give away their time.. Their life...

04/12/2017, 10:26 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: 😁😁😁😁 I remembered when I was in camp. I argued with the SAED guy that if he was doing good in what he's telling us. We would know and the whole thing won't be boring he was shocked

04/12/2017, 10:28 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: If I decide to become an entrepreneur, I'll be thinking towards food production
04/12/2017, 10:28 pm - Chika Nels: Yeah. Until you pay for the post camp training. That's the real deal
04/12/2017, 10:29 pm - Chika Nels: One of the largest business market. Everybody eats.
04/12/2017, 10:30 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: Why won't it be basic when they don't have a good understanding of what they're doing? From my view, most of them are probably ex coppers who foolishly lounged into "entrepreneurship". Now they're stranded cos they've not made their capital back. 
Example is the one that came with one "end hunger" something
04/12/2017, 10:31 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: I have people who paid and are still waiting even after POP

Someone has moved on 😁
04/12/2017, 10:38 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Not everyone can be an entrepreneur 

Some of us are born entrepreneurs who can turn anything to money.. from a young age you'll see them making money from leasing toys and stuff


Some others are born managers. They walk into any organization and instantly turn the place around and increase revenue X10. They can manage any situation perfectly 

Truth is entrepreneurs are BAD MANAGERS
and most managers can start an innovative business 


Study yourself! know who you are! If you are not an entrepreneur you'll fail woefully in business 

#myopinion
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: And entrepreneurship can also be learned.... it'll only take a loooong time and series of failures
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: There's nothing like too much food
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: ➕ it's a man who is full that will think of the excesses of life
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: But food production is not one easy task
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: So everyone would rather be caterers, makeup artists, and so on
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: It's entrepreneurship too after all
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: The new one is wig making... Braid wigs cost about 30k when it came out newly, now with 10k, you can get one... That's what I call "during the rave" business... It depreciates... Never heard of food depreciating like that
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Food rather increases... The only thing is that there might be inflation, then it'll go back to normal, never below
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Not saying food production is the way but if you must be an entrepreneur, it should be worthwhile
04/12/2017, 10:39 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: If you want to do a "during the wave" business, you need to be very creative and quick... Ensure to change as its changing
04/12/2017, 10:40 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: I don't think so... I think saed is another fraud...

04/12/2017, 10:45 pm - Chika Nels: Lol, that's relative. Shouldn't be generalised.
04/12/2017, 10:46 pm - Chika Nels: Chai, girls of nowadays sha. So it dinnor reach 15k😒
04/12/2017, 10:46 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Okay majority of entrepreneurs...

If the management of Facebook was not handled by his investors, shit would not have crossed the four walls of Harvard
04/12/2017, 10:47 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: It's a "during the wave" business... I have a friend who made her first million from it... She's very innovative
04/12/2017, 10:47 pm - Chika Nels: It has made people millionaires Fam, you are just not aware.

04/12/2017, 10:50 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Chai... ooooooo Nelson do you think it's Mark that is managing Facebook 


Someone that is investing millions in your business will definitely put someone in charge to make sure things run as planned
04/12/2017, 10:52 pm - Chika Nels: Lol, na.. The market is switching up. More affordable tablet soap is in demand. I know this cause I'm close to a manufacturer in that line.
04/12/2017, 10:55 pm - Chika Nels: Lol, that's not the point.
I think you need to read more about investors, their roles in business, business owners and roles of managers.
So we don't stress on nothing any further. 😅
04/12/2017, 10:55 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: I disagree... That Mark guy is someone who runs a "during the wave" business and he has been able to keep it on top... He's one entrepreneur I respect... What he has done with facebook is amazing really... Meanwhile investors don't manage the business na, well financially, yes... But ensuring it goes is the owner's responsibility cause it's like a baby... Na the mama know am
04/12/2017, 10:55 pm - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: It's just 3 - 5k... Not much jaree... It's cause you are a guy, console yourself
04/12/2017, 10:56 pm - Chika Nels: Well said.

04/12/2017, 11:00 pm - Chika Nels: As an investor I don't even have time to worry about managing your business I invested in because before I put my money in, I already did my own research.
Investors are just there for occasional checks, make sure their money is doubling or tripling as the case may be but they won't be direct that, that's their major goal. So they won't come off as not having the interest of the company at heart.
04/12/2017, 11:02 pm - ‪+234 810 129 0373‬: What kinda business can someone do gan,,,to blow o😥
04/12/2017, 11:03 pm - Chika Nels: Lol,  a lot to be learnt Fam.
You shouldn't see an investor as the suit Sayer of your business. Feeling because he invested some amount of money, he has the right to everything. That's the beginning of the end, if that's not controlled.
04/12/2017, 11:03 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: I know one baba...

05/12/2017, 8:19 am - Urenna: *Okorocha swears in sister as Happiness commissioner*

Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has sworn in 28 new commissioners and 27 Transition Committee Chairmen for the 27 local government councils in the state. He charged them to prove their worth in the service of the state and her people. One of the commissioners sworn in by the governor is his biological sister, Mrs. Ogechi Ololo (nee Okorocha). She is now the state’s Commissioner for Happiness and Couples’ Fulfillment.

Ololo, who is married to Chuks, an engineer, was the All Progressives Congress’ candidate into the House of Representatives for the Owerri Federal Constituency seat in 2015 and she has served in various capacities since Okorocha became the state governor in 2011. She had, before her new appointment, served as her brother’s Deputy Chief of Staff and Special Adviser on Domestic Matters.

Swearing in the new commissioners and the Transition Committee Chairmen on Monday at the Imo International Convention Centre, Owerri, the governor charged them to leave their marks in their respective ministries and local governments.

05/12/2017, 8:38 pm - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Hello, 

There is one Christmas Carol that has always baffled me - "The Twelve  Days of Christmas".

What in the world do leaping lords, French hens, swimming swans, and especially the partridge who won't come out of the pear tree have to do with Christmas? 

This week, I found out. 

From 1558 until 1829, Roman Catholics in England were not permitted to practice their faith openly. Someone during that era wrote this carol as a catechism song for young Catholics.  

It has two levels of meaning: the surface meaning plus a hidden meaning known only to members of their church. Each element in the carol has a code word for a religious reality which the children could remember.

. "My true love" means God. God sends gifts to us daily.
 
•  The partridge in a pear tree was Jesus Christ. 

•  Two turtle doves were the Old and New Testaments. 

•  Three French hens stood for faith, hope and love. 

•  The four calling birds were the four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke & John. 

•  The five golden rings recalled the Torah or Law, the first five books of the Old   Testament. 

•  The six geese a-laying stood for the six days of creation. 

•  Seven swans a-swimming represented the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Spirit--Prophesy, Serving, Teaching, Exhortation, Contribution, Leadership, and Mercy. 

• The eight maids a-milking were the eight beatitudes. 

• Nine ladies dancing were the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit--Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, and Self Control. 

• The ten lords a-leaping were the Ten Commandments. 

• The eleven pipers piping stood for the eleven faithful disciples. 
• The twelve drummers drumming symbolized the twelve points of belief in the Apostles' Creed. 

This is a history lesson for today. This knowledge was shared with me and I found it interesting and enlightening. 

 
Now I know how that strange song became a Christmas Carol. 

 
Have a Meaningful Yuletide Season! 🎄🙏🏼

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you in shortest advance……😘❤

The riddle was originally in Arabic and was then translated into English. 
Due to the many Arabic variations of it as well as differences that have come about due to translation, it is meaningless in English.

When translated properly, it goes something like this:

A 5 letter word, mentioned once in the Quran, beginning with mim. 
It is whiter than ice (or brighter than the Sun) and darker than night. 
Men use it thrice a day, while women only use it once in a lifetime. 
It is haram to eat, yet halal to drink.

The answer is Maqabir (Graveyards). 
Mentioned in surah Takarthur ie. Hata Zurtum al-Maqabir 
made up of 5 letters begins with mim                                                                                                                          Men visit it three times a day (ie. they bury the dead in it during three times viz. the periods between the three forbidden times) while women only visit the graveyard when they pass away.

The meat of the dead cannot be consumed ie. backbiting him is forbidden. 
The part about drinking being halal doesn't seen to have been solved. People have mentioned different interpretations, yet all seem farfetched.

That is what Sheikh Google says to your riddle

08/12/2017, 9:20 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: There are no special demons that operate in December, it is lack of planning and unnecessary competition that leads to all manner of tragedies this period.

I know a young man who bought a car during Christmas, went to driving school for few days, and chose to drive to the village by himself. Unfortunately, he entered under a trailer on the highway, and everybody in the car, including himself died. That was a careless death. The best thing he would have done was to pay an experienced driver to take him to the village. Many people will repeat this same mistake from next week, and when they die, we will say it is the spirit of ember month. Africans have demonic names for all their mistakes. I'm not saying that there are no forces of hell on the highway, but if we do our part, God will definitely protect us.

I know that some of us will say "God forbid," but the competition to show who is the wealthiest person in the village this season is also why some people may not see 2018. I have always maintained that having cars and building houses, and using expensive wine to wash your clothes is not a sign that you're rich. Stop trying to show the villagers that you're now a wealthy person. If you're truly wealthy we will know. We know that Mike Adenuga is a billionaire because his companies are there for all to see.

To go through this season unscattered, you need rest. Jesus said: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Matthew 11:28. The rest He is talking about is not idleness, but having peace of mind while chasing after your dreams.

I will never forget what my brother told me many years ago. He said, "Good things will never finish." That phrase delivered me from unnecessary competition forever. Don't get me wrong, it's good to be motivated or inspired by the achievements of others, but don't let it put you under unnecessary pressure. Celebrate their achievements and move on.

If you cannot comfortably buy cars for now kindly relax. You think you have seen cars? You have seen nothing yet. You will see real cars within the next ten years. So if you cannot comfortable afford the 2017 model of your dream car, kindly wait for the 2020 model. Don't be lazy, but don't kill yourself because you want to belong.

If you did not plan to travel to the village during this festive season, kindly stay back and rest. Let me be frank with you, January is almost here. You must do two things before you travel. Firstly, don't tamper with your children's school fees. Secondly, don't tamper with your house rent if you're still a tenant. Don't forget that Christmas is only one day celebration.

Finally, experts said that fatigue is the major cause of road accidents in Nigeria! As an experienced driver, I understand what they are talking about. The moment you find out that you're feeling sleepy while driving, don't sit there and be pleading the Blood of Jesus. Pull over immediately and wash your face. Walk around and probably rest for a while before you continue the journey. It is better to be late than for people to add 'late' before your name. 

Wisdom is profitable to direct!      ...Copied

11/12/2017, 7:36 am - Akolab: Emeka & Nkiru were taking a romantic walk down the beach one cool night. Emeka grab Nkiru's hands, draws her close to him, kisses her & says,"Baby! You know I so much love you. There's no one here. Its just us. Let's do WEEWEECHU.

"Nkiru looks around & says, "My love, I don't want to do WEEWEECHU please. Let's just hold hands & cuddle. "Emeka agrees.

After a while, Emeka asks her again, "Oh baby! Please my love! Let's do WEEWEECHU!

"Nkiru replies: "Baby'm, don't rush me. I don't want to do it. I just want to be wrapped in your arms." Emeka calms down.

After a longer while, Emeka can't hold it any longer. He says, "My sweetheart, its not fair oh! Let's do WEEWEECHU nah! Since last year oh!"

Nkiru reluctantly agrees! So Emeka immediately grabs her closer to him, hugs her tight, brought out the guitar strapped to his back & they both start singing:

"WEEWEE CHU A MERRY CHRISTMAS,
WEEWEECHU A MERRY CHRISTMAS,
WEEWEECHU A MERRY CHRISTMAS, AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!"

 If you have given another meaning to WEEWEECHU in your precious mind, get a spiritual eraser to clean it well.

I'm only trying 2 weechu a merry Christmas in advance. 😜😜😜😜😜

11/12/2017, 9:09 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: It's 5 minutes because it doesn't matter the amount of machines needed. It would still take  several machines the same 5 minutes to make same number of widget.

11/12/2017, 9:26 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: I don't know it 😕
11/12/2017, 9:27 pm - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: You guys all tried
11/12/2017, 9:27 pm - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: And for that
11/12/2017, 9:27 pm - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: I don't know i have some scholars who have 200 IQ greater than albert Einstein and walter O'Brien as my clique oo😀😀
11/12/2017, 9:30 pm - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: 1. The ball costs *5 cents* . You probably guessed 10 cents, didn't you? No judgment. A ball that costs 5 cents plus a bat that costs $1.05 will set you back $1.10. And $1.05 is exactly $1 more expensive than 5 cents. A study found that people who answered 10 cents were significantly less patient than those who got it correct.

2. It would take 100 machines 5 minutes to make 100 widgets. Your gut might tell you the answer is 100 minutes. From the question, we know that it takes 5 minutes for 1 machine to make 1 widget. Thus, it would take *5* *minutes* for 100 machines to make 100 widgets.

3. The lily pads would cover half the lake in 47 days. You might have guessed 24 days. It seems intuitive to halve the number of days because you're halving the size of the lilypad patch. But if the area of the lake covered in lilypads doubles every day, it would only take one day for it to go from being half covered to fully covered. Take one day away from 48 days and you're left with *47* .
11/12/2017, 9:30 pm - Ede: 😂😂😂😂

So my answer's wrong🤦🏾‍♂

11/12/2017, 10:52 pm - Ede: “The code I’m still ashamed of” @BillSourour

The client was extremely pleased with the site. So much so that their rep invited me and the entire team out to a fancy steak dinner.

The day of the dinner, shortly before leaving the office, a colleague emailed me a link to a news report online. It was about a young girl who had taken the drug I’d built the website for.

She had killed herself.

It turned out that among the main side effects of that drug were severe depression and suicidal thoughts.

The colleague who had emailed me didn’t show up to dinner.

I still went. It was difficult and awkward. I never mentioned the news report. I just ate my steak quietly and tried to force a smile when I could.

The next day, I called my sister. She was 19 at the time. We had discovered while working on the project that she had actually been prescribed the very drug I was building a site for.

13/12/2017, 12:31 pm - Chika Nels: The major secret of billionaires is their ability to find solutions to the challenges of humanity. All of them created solutions that brought the billions. Presently, Bill Gates is spending millions of dollars in search of renewable energy. By the time he finds one and become a major player in the electricity industry, we will say he is lucky. But we forget that he didn't pray for financial breakthrough, he only found a solution to a global problem.

Wealthy people don't necessarily look for money, they create solutions, and money will follow them! Larry Page and Sergey Brin went all out to help humanity find things faster on the internet, and billions of dollars followed them. Mark Zuckerberg created platforms for socialization, and over $71 billion followed him. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak went all out to reduce the size of computer. What problems are you solving for humanity? 

Some people spend weeks on the mountain praying for financial breakthrough without knowing what to do to be rich. They just want to be rich anyhow. It doesn't work that way. Real wealth comes through solving problems. Real wealth comes when we take a critical look around us, see the challenges that surrounds us, and proffer solutions to them. 

One of the major reasons why millions of Africans live below the poverty line is our belief that magic wands will suddenly mint money for us. How many cups of mustard seeds did Mark Zuckerberg ate that made him an 'instant' billionaire? How many bottles of anointing oil did Jeff Bezos drank that turned him into an overnight owner of Amazon? I'm not belittling prayer, but most of us pray amiss.  

This is how potential billionaires pray: "Dear Lord, Nigeria has electricity problem and I want to solve it. Lord, baptise me with fresh ideas on how to solve this problem, and connect me to the right partners to make it happen. Thank you Lord." God will definitely download creative ideas into their minds.

Unfortunately, this is how majority of us pray: "Oh Lord, I command anyone who said that I will not prosper to collapse and die by fire!" Another person will say: "Lord, I need financial favour. I need divine connections. I need financial breakthrough urgently. Lord send money to me today." When God listen to our prayers sometimes, I believe He will look down from the balcony of heaven and wonder why we failed to understand that wealth creation opportunities surrounds us. 

Dear friend, it is time to change your thinking and prayer pattern. Stop looking for shortcut to the top, start looking for the problems you can solve for humanity. Money is actually a reward for solving problems for people. Keep soaring!

15/12/2017, 7:25 pm - Chijioke: A library is usually a programming class and/or numerous functions/methods you call by reference in a block of code

A framework can just be defined as a way to achieve application-specific code, in my opinion they are mostly unnecessary, and the line between frameworks and libraries aren't clear cut, but the basic difference is frameworks provide a way to write more code to achieve specific goals while libraries are entirely generic

A CMS is a content management system, hardly different from a framework frankly, but unique to an organization and mostly UI enabled, so while most implementation of a framework by a user is through hard written codes, a CMS would be through a UI.

16/12/2017, 11:27 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Like poloniex, bittrex centralized
16/12/2017, 11:27 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Etherdelta binance decentralized
16/12/2017, 11:28 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: So they can be traded on those platforms
16/12/2017, 11:29 pm - Mosad: Yes.  Poloniex,  i know  but i get confused with coinbase
16/12/2017, 11:29 pm - Mosad: What's coinbase n is it different from what Poloniex offers?

16/12/2017, 11:40 pm - Mosad: Is it that I can only buy  altcoins with bitcoins?  Etherium classic is altcoin right?
16/12/2017, 11:42 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Yes once it's not bitcoin, it's an altcoin
16/12/2017, 11:42 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: More like that because, bitcoin is much easier to get
16/12/2017, 11:42 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: So you get it and exchange for the particular alt you wish to
16/12/2017, 11:46 pm - Mosad: Okay.  So,  to sell an altcoin,  i will convert to bit coin and sell.  Innit?
16/12/2017, 11:53 pm - Mosad: What will happen if we have a dearth of developers? Like someone decided to take out servers or something.  Facebook has had downtimes,  Google too.  Why can't crypto be different?

17/12/2017, 12:07 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Very true but like I said, cryptocurrency is a new revolution in the financial system

18/12/2017, 1:37 pm - Samah: VANITY has no other name but VANITY ( I thought you should read it too) 

A Wrist watch for 
N500, 000?? Will it show me when the world will end?

• A Bathing soap for 
N80, 000?? Will it wash away sins and sorrows?

• One Eye glasses for 
N350, 000?? If I wear it, will I be able to see the future?

• An Italian shoe for N150,000?? will i be walking on water?

• A Plasma TV for N500,000?? Will it show me the Judgement day on the last day live?

• A Gold plated mobile phone for 3 million naira. Chai!!! Will I use it to answer heaven's call?

• A Hand Bag for 1.3Million naira?? Will I put my life inside it?

• 20 thousand naira for a table in comedy show. Which kind
laugh I never laugh before?

• 3 Million naira per year at a university. After graduation, will they make me the president?

Sometimes, I wonder why some people spend like craze, knowing fully well that there are hungry children in the streets roaming about naked.

Remember
1. The smallest act of kindness you show, can change someone's life.

 2. Money only brings happiness if you help people with it.

3. Let someone say to you, BECAUSE OF YOU I DID NOT GIVE UP

When you are financially blessed, don't just raise your STANDARD OF LIVING, also raise your STANDARD OF GIVING.

I saw this and felt the Whole World should see it too. If you feel same, 😍share the   
post🙁☺.

19/12/2017, 3:24 pm - Akolab: Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, have, Tuesday, December 19, allegedly arrested the founder and chairman of Nigeria’s automobile company, Innoson Motors, Innocent Chukwuma.

Reports say Innoson was arrested at his residence in Enugu. Reports also said his arrest may not be unconnected with a legal case between the automobile company and Nigeria’s new generation bank, Guaranty Trust Bank. Confirming the development, the facebook handle of the automobile giant, claimed many workers sustained wounds following a sporadic shooting by operatives of the anti-graft agency. “Armed Police men firing live bullets and gunshots inside Dr Innocent Chukwuma’s residence. Tens of factory workers critically wounded.” “Like a commandor style, GTB uses EFFC to storm Dr. Innocent Chukwuma Enugu Residential Home to buggle him to Lagos like a common criminal without any prior invitation.” “Hundreds of factory workers from Innoson factory Emene Enugu protests the illegal bundling of Innoson to Lagos by EFCC organised by GTB.”

19/12/2017, 4:47 pm - Chika Nels: The major secret of billionaires is their ability to find solutions to the challenges of humanity. All of them created solutions that brought the billions. Presently, Bill Gates is spending millions of dollars in search of renewable energy. By the time he finds one and become a major player in the electricity industry, we will say he is lucky. But we forget that he didn't pray for financial breakthrough, he only found a solution to a global problem.

Wealthy people don't necessarily look for money, they create solutions, and money will follow them! Larry Page and Sergey Brin went all out to help humanity find things faster on the internet, and billions of dollars followed them. Mark Zuckerberg created platforms for socialization, and over $71 billion followed him. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak went all out to reduce the size of computer. What problems are you solving for humanity? 

Some people spend weeks on the mountain praying for financial breakthrough without knowing what to do to be rich. They just want to be rich anyhow. It doesn't work that way. Real wealth comes through solving problems. Real wealth comes when we take a critical look around us, see the challenges that surrounds us, and proffer solutions to them. 

One of the major reasons why millions of Africans live below the poverty line is our belief that magic wands will suddenly mint money for us. How many cups of mustard seeds did Mark Zuckerberg ate that made him an 'instant' billionaire? How many bottles of anointing oil did Jeff Bezos drank that turned him into an overnight owner of Amazon? I'm not belittling prayer, but most of us pray amiss.  

This is how potential billionaires pray: "Dear Lord, Nigeria has elecrity problem and I want to solve it. Lord, baptise me with fresh ideas on how to solve this problem, and connect me to the right partners to make it happen. Thank you Lord." God will definitely download creative ideas into their minds.

Unfortunately, this is how majority of us pray: "Oh Lord, I command anyone who said that I will not prosper to collapse and die by fire!" Another person will say: "Lord, I need financial favour. I need divine connections. I need financial breakthrough urgently. Lord send money to me today." When God listen to our prayers sometimes, I believe He will look down from the balcony of heaven and wonder why we failed to understand that wealth creation opportunities surrounds us. 

Dear Sir/Madam, it is time to change our thinking and prayer pattern. We should stop looking for shortcut to the top, start looking for the problems you can solve for humanity. Money is actually a reward for solving problems for people. Keep soaring!

19/12/2017, 10:24 pm - Mosad: how can we solve the power problem ?
19/12/2017, 10:25 pm - Mosad: i propose a solution to lagos' transport system: Agbero,drivers and coductors
19/12/2017, 10:26 pm - Akolab: Listening
19/12/2017, 10:27 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Hmm wow! okay let's analyze it and possibly implement it
19/12/2017, 10:31 pm - Mosad: step 1: Educate drivers and conductors by organizing free adult classes in all local govt in Lagos.
19/12/2017, 10:31 pm - Chika Nels: 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Let's hear boss
19/12/2017, 10:32 pm - Chika Nels changed the subject from "e-Learn Hub" to "e-Learning..."
19/12/2017, 10:34 pm - Akolab: How would you get them to participate??
19/12/2017, 10:35 pm - Mosad: step 2: Issue out id cards(electronic) to these Drivers and conductors that have passed these classes. these id card will bear the NURTW logo and will be operated under the body allowing NURTW to keep the database of all drivers n coductors.
19/12/2017, 10:35 pm - ‪+234 909 192 0347‬: What will you be teaching them?

19/12/2017, 10:37 pm - Mosad: step 3: Upgrade NURTW  offices around the state. Equip with computers and let the "now agberos" be trained to use computers.
19/12/2017, 10:37 pm - Akolab: Batch by batch now, they can't lecture every one together
19/12/2017, 10:37 pm - Mosad: pls i am coming. i will answer ur questions .....

19/12/2017, 10:39 pm - Akolab: Can I make it malt??
19/12/2017, 10:44 pm - Mosad: step 4 : some of these "modern agberos" will be stationed at bustops to scan idcards (smart cards ) of these drivers n conductors to know if they have paid their tax and check if they are genuine drivers.  it will help curb kidnappings
19/12/2017, 10:48 pm - Mosad: step 5 : Drivers and conductors will be evaluated monthly . Mental evaluation i mean.
19/12/2017, 10:51 pm - Mosad: That's all .

They didn't even pay attention in school when their brains were fresh
Talk less of now🤔
19/12/2017, 10:59 pm - Mosad: It is going to be all about record keeping. People operating the Bet Shops use computers so why will this be different?  They are humans too so anyone that commits any form of crime will face the law like normal citizens
19/12/2017, 11:01 pm - Dinah: Because the cycle is not complete yet😒
19/12/2017, 11:01 pm - Mosad: They will when they know Money is involved and that is the only way they can make money. We won't be teaching them calculus or anything advance. Just the basics.  Read, write  and operate the computer .

19/12/2017, 11:09 pm - Chika Nels: Adult classes : what's the purpose of this. How does it help to solve transportation problem??
19/12/2017, 11:10 pm - Mosad: these guys operate Baba Ijebu na. They enagage in all forms of bet online. Over 1.5, double chance am. it took me time to understand how these are calculated. Yes they can learn.
19/12/2017, 11:11 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Fine, they understand the gimmicks but mind you, They aren't the computer operators......
19/12/2017, 11:12 pm - Chika Nels: If some drivers/conductors  don't participate, they don't loose anything right? 
Because they can choose to continue their normal lives seeing how stressful this would be for them already.
19/12/2017, 11:13 pm - Chika Nels: Again,  what's the purpose of this computer training?
How will it help our transport system?
19/12/2017, 11:13 pm - Mosad: education empowers one. This is aim at making them a better person.  it wont make all of them  responsible but it will go a long way to help majority used their discretion about what they read and hear.  i mean the transportation workers who are not educated.  it will increase literacy level
19/12/2017, 11:13 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: I guess it'd be mandatory
19/12/2017, 11:14 pm - Chika Nels: What system would be involved here?
19/12/2017, 11:15 pm - Mosad: trust me , They will learn and know more than u think. Have u seen some Yahoo boys who never went to sch? yet they hide I.P, they  generate credit cards, the do wire transfer via the computers.  These agberos are smarter than u think o.
19/12/2017, 11:16 pm - Chika Nels: Then I guess the subject matter on ground should not be "solution to Lagos transport system" but "Educational empowerment of drivers and conductors in Nigeria"
19/12/2017, 11:16 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: I like the fact that this can curb kidnapping and also... help the have an organized database of road workers
19/12/2017, 11:17 pm - Chika Nels: What'l steps would be put in  place to make sure it pulls through? How will you enforce it @2348069725575
19/12/2017, 11:17 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Monthly... lmao nahhhhh
Won't work
19/12/2017, 11:17 pm - Dinah: Great Idea
But How does this proposal address 'power' problem?
And what kind of power is being referred here?
19/12/2017, 11:17 pm - Mosad: it will be Mandatory and we will try as much as possible to eliminate all forms of stress for them. As a matter of fact , the drivers will be glad that we are helping remove agberos on the street that collects money anyhow from them and disrupt the smooth running of their business.  It will be mandatory to comply.
19/12/2017, 11:18 pm - Chika Nels: Again, what's the essence of this. What does mental evaluation represent in this context?
19/12/2017, 11:20 pm - Chika Nels: What steps would be taken to "remove stress for them"?
As a matter of fact,  you can't be sure how the drivers would take the new development.
19/12/2017, 11:20 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: @2348069673561 , this was a reply to @2348097203762 and not related to the current topic on ground
19/12/2017, 11:20 pm - Mosad: i am not sure we have these Agberos in the north. Lagos been a financial hub and a city that buzzes every minute of the day. These agberos are menace to the transport system. As we all know, education is a another form of empowerment.
19/12/2017, 11:21 pm - Mosad: yes. it will.  these people just need organisation .
19/12/2017, 11:22 pm - Dinah: I am lost, please find me

19/12/2017, 11:29 pm - Mosad: Just as we have those at bustops chasing busses up and down shouting : Owo mi da, hitting and fighting conductors.  Lagos state have created bus stops for these drivers where they stop temporarily to let passengers alight. This is where the reformed Agbero will be stationed to check cards of every buses that stops and red flagged any that flaunts this rule . ( he alerts the police about this)

19/12/2017, 11:36 pm - Mosad: it is stress free. i had said that earlier.  After being trained/ educated, u will get an id card, and then u start work immediately and u visit their office to pay ur tax.  They might not even visit the NURTW to pay the tax they can do that via e payment or do the conventional system of paying at a kiosk located at a bustop
19/12/2017, 11:40 pm - Mosad: These Agberos answer to someone. They are loyalist to Pasuma, Saheed Osupa, Malaika, Small doctor , Kwam 1. Mc Oluomo even the Nurtw president. All we need to do is let these people endorse the idea and talk to the Agbero  believe me they will hear. I know these people, they will kill for Pasuma in his absence.
19/12/2017, 11:41 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Hmmm

19/12/2017, 11:42 pm - Mosad: you think so?  we thought so when NURTW started making them wear uniform ( white and green) and giving them tags and id cards.  we are not taking their jobs from them we are just making it better for them and us.

19/12/2017, 11:55 pm - Akolab: Call it whatever you want
19/12/2017, 11:56 pm - Mosad: Thanks Dinah.  Yes they pragmatic and the idea is open to criticism.  It's is an idea and i pray and hope we can actualize it.  If these people(Politicktians) won't think sensibly , we should think for them . Making Nigeria great is a collective effort .  I just want to stop complaining and solve a problem. Macnels post  about solving a problem is quite inspiring .
20/12/2017, 12:00 am - Akolab: Thanks for the Malts☺
20/12/2017, 12:03 am - Mosad: you are welcome. Pls for today , refrain from making too much sense. I don't have money for another crate o.

20/12/2017, 12:10 am - Chika Nels: Nice one Mosad. This was an interesting session. An idea just fell from above.
We should do this often. 

After something like this, you *challenge someone* to "come up with a problem he/she can solve in Nigeria" within your stipulated time(not less than 48hrs),  the person comes at that time to defend his /her idea. While we ask questions, criticise, and judge the feasibility of the solution.
Would be another great avenue for learning here. 
Let's Call it *#problemsolvingchallenge*😁
20/12/2017, 12:18 am - Mosad: <Media omitted>

Hence, in a way, save cost in the long run and helps with ease to use

21/12/2017, 9:31 am - Akolab: #Innoson group Vs GTBank : 30 Key Points you need to know about their dispute 

1 - At all Material time , Innoson Nigeria Ltd operates a Current Account with GTBank .

2 - Innoson obtained , and had repaid same , a loan of N1.3billion from GTB Which was secured with a legal mortgage of its properties valued at more than N1.4billion .

3 - Innoson discovered that GTBank imposed excess and unlawful charges in its Current account .

4  Innoson Group Complained to GTBank on his discovery of access charges on his account .

5 - Both parties ( Innoson and GTBank ) agreed to invite an independent auditing firm that will be agreed by both parties .

*6*- At the end , MULTI-WINGS Consulting Firm of Auditors was invited to properly audit Innoson Nigeria Ltd Current account No 0043753636 domiciled with Nnewi Branch of GTBank . The audit covers a period from March 2004 to Dec 2011 .

7 - After the account was audited , it was discovered that GTBank has been illegally deducting excess bank charges on its overdraft facility to the Innoson to the tune of seven hundred and Eighty-Six Million, Two Hundred and Five Thousand , Nine Hundred and Fifty-Five Naira , Ninety Nine kobo ( N786,205,955.99).

8 -  GTBank was shocked at the audit report when the report was forwarded to it .They replied in their letter to Innoson on 20th January , 2012 that it will investigate the issue raised and will get back to Innoson on the Conclusion of its investigation .

9 - In the month of September 2012 , GTBank wrote to Innoson that from their personal audit report , the excess bank charges was Five Hundred and Fifty-Nine Million , three Hundred and Seventy-Two naira ,Nine kobo ( N 559.3Million).

10 - Innoson agreed to their version and decided to accept payment from it in the spirit of amicable resolution.

*11*- Innoson also requested that the said agreed amount of N559.3million be paid with a 22% interest rate because Innoson had been repaying all his loan with GTBank at 22% interest rate.

12 - GTBank refused and said that the best they can repay excess and illegal deduction is at 7% interest rate . This led to another disagreement between Innoson and GTBank .

13 - As a result , in 2012 , Innoson sued GTBank at Federal High Court Awka with Suit No : FHC/Awk/Cs/2012 .

14 - Federal High Court, Awka delivered Judgement in favour of Innoson in excess of N4.7billion against GTBank.

Delivering Judgement in suit no : FHC /Awk/ CS / 139/2012 , the FHC awarded N4.7billion to Innoson Motors against GTBank .
The court also ordered GTBank to pay 22 % (percent ) interest on the Judgement debt until all the payment had been made to Innoson .

15 - In 2013 , GTBank appealed against the judgement to the Court of Appeal, Enugu Division, appoxite appeal No: CA/E/288/2013 .

16 - The Court of Appeal , Enugu in a Considered ruling ordered GTBank to pay the Judgement debt of N6billion Inclusive of the accrued interest and any interest that would subsequently accrue thereon into an interest yielding account in the Name of the Chief Registrar of the Court .

17 - In its various affidavits, particularly at the Court of Appeal in suit no : CA/E/288/2013 , GTBank deposed that if it pays the outstanding Judgement debt of N6billion , much less the N8.5billion , it could go bankrupt and be out of business .

18 - GTBank went to the Supreme Court .The case is still in the Supreme Court , while the Judgement debt is about N8billion now to be paid to Innoson by GTBank .

#Another Cases:
IBADAN Cases : Innoson /GTBank/Nigerian Custom Service :

19 -  Nigerian Customs Service Auctioned Innoson goods .

20 - Innoson challenged the action Nigerian Custom Service for auctioning its goods at Federal High Court , Ibadan .

21 - On July 29 ,2011, In a Garnishee Order Absolute , the Federal High Court sitting in Ibadan ordered GTBank to Pay Innoson #2,048,737,443,67 (#2billion) from Nigerian Customs account in GTBank .

22 - Rather than Comply with the Garnishee Order Absolute of the Court , GTBank on February 6, 2015 appealed the Judgement , but the Court of Appeal in Appeal no. CA/1/258/2011 affirmed the Judgement of the Federal High Court and ordered GTBank to pay the Judgement debt of #2,048,737,443.67 (#2.048billion) to Innoson .

23 - GTBank , instead , appealed to the Supreme Court against the Court of Appeal's decision where GTBank claimed through a motion in suit no : Sc /694/2014, that the Court of Appeal Judgement in Ibadan (CA/I/258/2011) was procured by suspicious means .

24 - On May 12,  2017 , Supreme Court in its wisdom and rightly , dismissed that unfounded and exasperating claim of GTB against Innoson .

25 - As a result , Innoson commenced a N400 billion suit against GTBank , in the suit No: FCT /HC/CV/2448/2017 at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja .

#Another issues 

26 - Consequently , in order to save itself from paying the outstanding Judgement debts to Innoson , the GTBbank filed a petition against Innoson alleging forgery  which led to the suit No : FHC /L/565C/2015 by Police .

27 - On February 17, 2016 , Police properly and Competently withdraw the charges against Innoson , saying they needed to properly investigate the bank's complaints first and see if they had merits .

28 - On September 1 , 2014 ,  GTBank secured an ex parte order on Innoson Nigeria Limited, dated September 1, 2014 with suit no FHC/L/CS/1119/2014 , filed before a Federal High Court in Lagos , between GTBank and Innoson Nigeria Limited , issued by *Justice Okon Abang* , ordering that , pending the hearing and the determination of the substantive suit , all Commercial Banks in Nigeria were restrained from accepting in any manner whatsoever to any mandate or instruction presented to them by Innoson Companies or any of its agents or nominees for withdrawal of any sum of money standing to the credit of any account maintained by the company in all the banks.

29 - However , on June 10, 2015 , *Justice Saliu Saidu* of the Federal High Court , Lagos , in a Considered ruling set aside the ex parte order of September 1, 2014 , by Justice Okon Abang and the writ of summon as well .

30 - Innoson then slammed a N30 billion suit on Guaranty Trust Bank for what it had suffered in monetary terms and reputational terms during the months when the accounts of its companies in all Nigerian banks were frozen.
With Innoson winning both cases at the High Court and both cases at the Appeal Court, and GTB appealing, both cases are awaiting the verdict of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile the fresh N30 billion naira suit has just gone to the High Court to start its legal journey.

....

In all , Innoson has won two High Court cases and two Appeal Court cases all against GTBank .

Innoson as at today has Judgement debt over about N10billion based on 22% interest rate against GTBank .

#Questions for EFCC :

(i) Now where is the EFCC coming from in all these ? 

(ii) Does EFCC actually understand their duties here ?

(iii) Is EFCC by their action not sabotaging Nigerian economy ?

(iv)  If EFCC should to arrest any of the parties , shouldn't GTBank who dubiously deducted Innoson money from his account and have debt of about N8billion to pay Innoson that they should arrest ?

21/12/2017, 9:30 pm - Mosad: The noises and rowdiness.  Can it be curbed?
21/12/2017, 9:32 pm - Tosin Lawal: Can the system for curbing it be managed
21/12/2017, 9:40 pm - Mosad: How do u mean?

21/12/2017, 10:02 pm - Tosin Lawal: Let's say a monitor indicator for buses movement was created in place of the shouting, can it be managed??
21/12/2017, 10:26 pm - Mosad: To be factual.  We have a bad maintenance culture in Nigerian.  If u mean maintenance then that's another problem to be solved in Nigeria.  If u mean manage as in  "management"  then we can.  Brt comes to mind
21/12/2017, 10:47 pm - Mosad: if u suggest Monitor indicator, what provision is made for the blind?
21/12/2017, 11:00 pm - Tosin Lawal: Automated voice Systems too can be added to it
21/12/2017, 11:06 pm - Mosad: Nice but how will fares be collected?
21/12/2017, 11:11 pm - Tosin Lawal: Definitely going to need operators around too now

21/12/2017, 11:12 pm - Tosin Lawal: Even if you're going to make a system that's fully automated like UK people that use bus passes for their payment, you still need people to monitor 
Nigerians are very mischievous in their ways normally
21/12/2017, 11:16 pm - Mosad: i think we should avoid copying the  whites and adopt our own unique system too. we know ourselves in Africa. If we are going to let conductors stay in the buses , no problem  as long as they don't constitute a nuisance.
21/12/2017, 11:17 pm - Tosin Lawal: There's nothing wrong in replicating a method that would work though
21/12/2017, 11:17 pm - Tosin Lawal: If it is optimally satisfying, why not??
21/12/2017, 11:18 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Scarcity of lower denominations....

Lemme start by saying that in a sane state, lower denominations are expected to be available often so as to ease inflation and encourage people to buy and sell at lower prices - trust me there's more technicality to that...


In Nigeria on the there hand, virtually all our lower denominations are becoming useless _Where are the coins, ₦5 and ₦10: hardly can you see anything tangible to buy with them_ and guess what, e.g. Shuttle Buses will call fare ₦70 but you'll be charged ₦80 for it cos of lack of lower denominations to fund you. This has slightly moved the prices of commodities up across several sectors especially the informal sector (this accounts for the largest share of the population and one of the smallest contribution to the nation's GDP).
21/12/2017, 11:18 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Now the case for lower currencies
21/12/2017, 11:23 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Wonder why CBN under Soludo wanted to reintroduce coins but failed? It was because the prices for minting these currencies are almost the same e.g. the cost of minting ₦5 is almost the same cost of minting ₦50 because its a fiat money which doesn't take into congnizance and they're all fiat money
21/12/2017, 11:24 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: S ọ It's better to mint higher values
21/12/2017, 11:26 pm - Mosad: yes  o but we can be different in a good way. German toilets are quite different from British toilet.  Double decker is trademark of UK  only and many more.  I am just saying as an African, we should create our own system . It wont be bad to do that. will it?
21/12/2017, 11:29 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: This is why cryptocurrency/programmable money is the way. Limited in supply, p2p, highly transparent and deflationary in nature. 🤓
21/12/2017, 11:30 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Where you believe it or not, it's the fact 👌
21/12/2017, 11:30 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: *whether
21/12/2017, 11:52 pm - Samah: Ah ...some people they sleep like ghost inside bus
21/12/2017, 11:54 pm - Mosad: Abi na.  exactly
22/12/2017, 12:19 am - Tosin Lawal: Atall o
22/12/2017, 2:38 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Another reason being that most people manhandle those denominations at its peak at this time of festivities. So to prolong the lifespan of new lower denominations, they are not so much during these times
22/12/2017, 2:40 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Bro, if you clearly understand the technicalities of finance or money, you will not be saying this
22/12/2017, 2:40 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: *Crypto currency has failed to be an alternative to fiat money*
22/12/2017, 2:40 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: 😄
22/12/2017, 2:41 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Wrong!
22/12/2017, 2:41 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Bitcoin or any of those is not an alternative to holding naira, it has reduced itself to just yet another investment
22/12/2017, 2:41 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Explain sir
22/12/2017, 2:42 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: People now primarily hold it *not for exchange purposes but for store of value for future increase in value*
22/12/2017, 2:42 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Now very good
22/12/2017, 2:42 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: It's just like an alternative to stock, investment portfolio, and other assets
22/12/2017, 2:43 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Before something is seen as a store of value what is it see first as?
22/12/2017, 2:43 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: *Money shouldn't be as volatile as that*
22/12/2017, 2:43 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Roger said this because as usual he spams the network
22/12/2017, 2:44 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: This same statement
22/12/2017, 2:44 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: What is the volatility of fiat please?
22/12/2017, 2:44 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I think it will be a very bad idea to start an argument on that...

I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad so get to understand that too
22/12/2017, 2:44 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: And what do you mean by volatility?
22/12/2017, 2:45 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm not saying you're saying that too 😊
22/12/2017, 2:45 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I think you should understand all these terms and why they are important
22/12/2017, 2:45 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Have you read bitcoin white paper?
22/12/2017, 2:45 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: A peer to peer cash system
22/12/2017, 2:45 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Just be calm,

All you Bitcoin guys are always thinking analysts are attacking you and just say things without deep understanding of it
22/12/2017, 2:46 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: What makes man send money from one end to another without a third party should not be regarded as money?
22/12/2017, 2:46 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Well, if you won't allow me to explain what volatility is, then good night sir
22/12/2017, 2:46 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: But a just a store of value?
22/12/2017, 2:46 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: No we are not brother
22/12/2017, 2:47 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Oga calm down na
22/12/2017, 2:47 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: There are so many investment portfolios that are used as exchange too
22/12/2017, 2:47 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Air your view sir 😄
22/12/2017, 2:47 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I have done this with you guys over and over and I am just tired
22/12/2017, 2:48 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: No one is spoiling anything for you. In fact, we advise our clients to consider it as an investment portfolio first
22/12/2017, 2:48 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Then, they know how better to deal with it
22/12/2017, 2:48 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Volatility isn't a bad word - it is just a degree of responsiveness
22/12/2017, 2:49 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Lemme give you a clear scenario of money
22/12/2017, 2:50 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I didn't say it is sir 🙂
22/12/2017, 2:50 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Ok good
22/12/2017, 2:55 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If I buy one kg of garri for ₦5 today, I should be able to buy that one kg for that same price or a slight difference next week. I shouldn't go to the market tomorrow and I am told it's ₦10, next tomorrow and it's ₦20

If I am buying that garri and needs a replacement, I will be able to cover cost and also the garri will always change in value at any cost... Once, I see that this garri is rapidly increasing in value in short term, I will be forced to keep the garri with the hope of selling it at a huge price in the future.
To me, that garri is no longer for drinking - it has changed from being a food to being an investment
22/12/2017, 2:56 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Do you understand this scenario?
22/12/2017, 2:58 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Very clear. You do have a point sir
22/12/2017, 2:58 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If ₦ is appreciating by 100% everyday, will you be able to use it to transact like an ordinary consumer freely when you don't what next might happen to it? No, your mindset will change. Even if you want to transact with it, you will either transact with the future in mind.
Hence, it's now an investment portfolio
22/12/2017, 2:59 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: But the reason you can freely transact with ₦ currently is because we all believe it's the same value everytime and everywhere
22/12/2017, 3:00 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: However, you should also note that the major problem programmable money came to solve was inflation hence dealing with that
22/12/2017, 3:00 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: can you explain what you think inflation is?
22/12/2017, 3:01 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Do you think Bitcoin or a currency of the future will cater for inflation?
22/12/2017, 3:01 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Simple when the currency purchasing power becomes weak with time
22/12/2017, 3:02 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: There's a big difference between inflation (aggregate price level increase) and Purchasing Power
22/12/2017, 3:03 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: They sure  have similarities but nay, they are different
22/12/2017, 3:03 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Inflation is not a one item thing
22/12/2017, 3:03 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: That the price tends to increase with time should not becloud your mind with the fact that folks thereby create means to earn such value commodity or currency
22/12/2017, 3:03 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Hence it's used a means of payment
22/12/2017, 3:04 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Also note the fact that it's about wealth sovereignty
22/12/2017, 3:04 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: There are several investment portfolios that can be used to hedge against the future
22/12/2017, 3:04 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: That I can spend my money without seemingly any rule and regulations by a financial institution
22/12/2017, 3:04 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: What I am saying is this
22/12/2017, 3:05 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Sure but there's a much better one
22/12/2017, 3:05 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: That everyone is into BitCoin doesn't mean there won't be inflation
22/12/2017, 3:06 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: What do you mean sir?
22/12/2017, 3:06 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Inflation on one end is just a relation of interplay of aggregate demand and supply
22/12/2017, 3:06 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Explain sir
22/12/2017, 3:06 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Ok...
22/12/2017, 3:06 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: When using this terms, always note the word aggregate
22/12/2017, 3:07 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: That iya sade increased her rice from ₦5 to ₦10 doesn't mean there's an inflation
22/12/2017, 3:07 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: How fluctuating is this price change?
22/12/2017, 3:08 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: The concept Fluctuations is 100% different from volatility
22/12/2017, 3:08 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Kindly note that too
22/12/2017, 3:08 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I won't dwell too much cos I've still got lot of work to do in the office
22/12/2017, 3:09 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: So I'm a bit tired
22/12/2017, 3:11 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Following...
22/12/2017, 3:11 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: But let's say I buy 1kg rice of ₦5 (2017 price) for ₦10 (2018 adjusted inflation price)
22/12/2017, 3:12 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Both the buyer and seller have hedged over inflation but what have they done to the value of the good purchased and what has happened to the price in the future?

Consider that
22/12/2017, 3:12 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: This might not be the exact thing that happened with Bitcoin but this is the simplest way to summarise it
22/12/2017, 3:13 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I have moved the price in 2017 from ₦5 to ₦10. Therefore, the 1kg rice is worth ₦10 that moment
22/12/2017, 3:15 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: In the future, if something occurs and 1kg rice was only valued in real terms as ₦7, then I have lost ₦3 as a buyer and the seller have gained ₦3 extra
22/12/2017, 3:15 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: If otherwise, I will gain and the seller will lose
22/12/2017, 3:17 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: So because it's an investment portfolio, I won't consume the rice till next year too so I can get my full yield. I will also be tempted to hold that rice till 2019 so as to gain more
22/12/2017, 3:17 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: So that's how it is sir
22/12/2017, 3:17 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I just hope you understand this scenario clearly
22/12/2017, 3:18 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: No doubt it can also be seen as an investment portfolio however, you cannot neglect the fact that it's a currency
22/12/2017, 3:19 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: What's a currency? A means of a payment
22/12/2017, 3:19 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: This simply what money is all about
22/12/2017, 3:19 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I'm done sir
22/12/2017, 3:20 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Because I know you still want to prove that it is accepted all over the world as a means of payment when I just told you that some investment portfolios too can be used as a means of payment
22/12/2017, 3:20 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: If I see it as an investment portfolio, I don't have it or I intend to have it what do I do? Simply I offer a service and I'm paid for it in that currency
22/12/2017, 3:21 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: What is money if I may ask sir?
22/12/2017, 3:21 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: And just explained how the two payments differ
22/12/2017, 3:21 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Money, currency are two different concepts sir
22/12/2017, 3:22 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm only trying to let you understand this from another angle sir
22/12/2017, 3:22 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: We are talking about "Fiat and Crypto" currencies

Do you know the term money market refers to a short term investment market?
22/12/2017, 3:23 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Many people are fighting it hard but BitCoin is slowly degenerating into a brilliant Money Market portfolio
22/12/2017, 3:24 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: This is the sole reason I'm now interested in buying it
22/12/2017, 3:24 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I get you sir
22/12/2017, 3:24 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: But that it's a means of payment doesn't qualify it as a currency
22/12/2017, 3:25 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: That ISIS sell Crude in exchange for arms and grenades from all their buyers doesn't qualify that as their currency
22/12/2017, 3:27 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: That under war circumstances, soldiers use bullets as the sole means of payment to buy whiskeys from themselves or locals doesn't make it a currency sir
22/12/2017, 3:27 am - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Just try and get me right sir
22/12/2017, 3:27 am - Akanni Hafeez: 🛌🏼🛌🏼🛌🏼

22/12/2017, 8:33 am - Chijioke: My guy, libertarianism has killed bitcoin
22/12/2017, 8:33 am - Chijioke: It is not more than a commodity, not more than an investment
22/12/2017, 8:33 am - Chijioke: At no point in it's existence has it been a currency
22/12/2017, 8:34 am - Chijioke: "Cryptocurrency" is just a name
22/12/2017, 8:35 am - Chijioke: The fact that you can use something to buy a good does not make it a currency, wall street boys, use their investment portfolio to buy loans and swap them for luxurious properties, vehicles(feraris,lamborghini) etc
22/12/2017, 8:36 am - Chijioke: But you don't see anyone referring to stocks and securities as money
22/12/2017, 8:37 am - Chijioke: One of the first ever developers of the Bitcoin Core Team, said "as a project Bitcoin has failed"
22/12/2017, 8:37 am - Chijioke: To say otherwise, especially without attempt of revisionism, is to show an entire lack of understanding of economics
22/12/2017, 8:40 am - ‪+234 802 121 0067‬: Never say goodbye when you still want to try. Never give up when you can still take it. Never say you don't love them when you can't let go.

Morning guys
22/12/2017, 8:41 am - Akolab: Hmmmm
22/12/2017, 8:41 am - Chijioke: Let's even talk in less technical terms, from an extremely layman perspective, if I price my good in November at $10, I would have to set the Bitcoin equivalent at 0.00125 ($1 = 8000BTC) , but in less than 30 days the price changes so much that I will be overcharging when I revisit my goods price 0.00125BTC = $18.75 ($1 = 15000)
22/12/2017, 8:42 am - Akanni Hafeez: Matters of the heart😰
22/12/2017, 8:42 am - Chijioke: Failure!!!!!!
22/12/2017, 10:17 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Who? 😊
22/12/2017, 10:18 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm just waking 😂...shall we continue @2348179222327 ?
22/12/2017, 10:18 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: In what sense?
22/12/2017, 10:18 am - Chijioke: Mike Hearn
22/12/2017, 10:18 am - Chijioke: Sure
22/12/2017, 10:20 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let me say something, if the money (supply) of nation can be controlled the people are automatically controlled
22/12/2017, 10:20 am - Chijioke: But make sure you understand economics, present empirical evidence, and refrain from crytocurrency parlance/rhetoric/colloquialism
22/12/2017, 10:20 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: This is where you get it wrong
22/12/2017, 10:20 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Oga me no sabi your kain English oh 😢
22/12/2017, 10:21 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let's rewind sir
22/12/2017, 10:21 am - Chijioke: 1. It is controlled in the interest of those people, and as a direct result of the activities of those people, 
2. Only a capitalist economy, needs to control money supply/demand
22/12/2017, 10:22 am - Chijioke: What I mean is try not to use recycled crypto world talk,
22/12/2017, 10:22 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Why was cowrie regarded as money?
22/12/2017, 10:23 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: So how has this form succeeded and improved fiat currency?
22/12/2017, 10:23 am - Chijioke: I once read mostly for it's designation by state-empires as money
22/12/2017, 10:23 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: How has the debt rate of countries reduced?
22/12/2017, 10:24 am - Chijioke: Nations have the power to alter inflation at will, isn't this a good thing? 
Economics is meant to serve man and not man serving economics, that's the thing libertarian/anarchists don't understand
22/12/2017, 10:24 am - Chijioke: Are you saying they shouldn't alter it? They should let it be?
22/12/2017, 10:24 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Till tomorrow, fiat currency would continue to suffer depreciation yes or no sir?
22/12/2017, 10:25 am - Chijioke: All this is immaterial to our discussion and frankly a disservice to your argument
22/12/2017, 10:25 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Tell this to Nigeria and the almighty US so they can offset their debts
22/12/2017, 10:25 am - Chijioke: Considering bitcoin has fallen by 30% in the last 4 hours as reported by CNN Money
22/12/2017, 10:26 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Now this where you'd see that technology came to disrupt the state of things
22/12/2017, 10:26 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: We are talking about a free economy system
22/12/2017, 10:26 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let me tell you something...mathematics can never go wrong
22/12/2017, 10:27 am - Chijioke: Lol, Nigeria has individuals being manipulated by US, US actively manipulates their currency so as not to pay out a strong dollar when nations request debt repayment
22/12/2017, 10:27 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: How my brother...that make our convo more pragmatic for everyone to relate sir
22/12/2017, 10:27 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Expect!
22/12/2017, 10:27 am - Chijioke: Ways to do this are:
1. Goods price manipulation
2. Petro dollar maipualtion
3. Interest rate
22/12/2017, 10:28 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: If you listen to my VN last week you'd see why price correction is important to the ecosystem sir 😊
22/12/2017, 10:28 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Air your views, I'm listening sir...
22/12/2017, 10:28 am - Chijioke: Once again libertarianism, how has a free market economy helped 99.999% of the World?
22/12/2017, 10:30 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I disagree, with the debt rate us still keep shouldering?
22/12/2017, 10:30 am - Chijioke: Please, there is no economic principle ever written by anyone ever renowned that states that price correction is a prevalent necessity of supply-demand chain
22/12/2017, 10:30 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Should I respond to this sir?
22/12/2017, 10:30 am - Chijioke: Price correction is as a result of the consistent pump and dump schemes and scams existent in all cryptocurrencies
22/12/2017, 10:31 am - Chijioke: In most nations they'll have arrested the perpetrators
22/12/2017, 10:31 am - Chijioke: Of course
22/12/2017, 10:32 am - Chijioke: It only rose this much, because manipulation of money supply isn't a necessity for a socialist economy like China, and they are ever ready to lend out
22/12/2017, 10:32 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: By the way the Mike Hearn I know has nothing to do with bitcoin or even crypto sir
22/12/2017, 10:33 am - Chijioke: Fiscal policy has collapsed several empires and nations, from Rome to Soviet Union, either way US will feel the brunt
22/12/2017, 10:34 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Haba! Haba!! Nawa oh 😢😂
22/12/2017, 10:34 am - Chijioke: I told you before we started, present empirical evidence, you lot argue without proof
22/12/2017, 10:35 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Can I have the floor now sir? We take it one after the other
22/12/2017, 10:35 am - Chijioke: The inventor/programmer of the second most popular bitcoin library, *BitcoinJ*, has nothing to do with cryptocurrency?, or the fact that he is a former Bitcoin Core developer, is exclusive to the fact that he was once a member?
22/12/2017, 10:36 am - Chijioke: This is Mike Hearn's blog written by he himself
https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.5jvqjf9lg
22/12/2017, 10:37 am - Chijioke: Go on
22/12/2017, 10:37 am - Tosin Lawal: Bitcoin is 13629dollars now sha
22/12/2017, 10:38 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Alright sir...thanks 😄
22/12/2017, 10:39 am - ‪+234 812 093 8116‬: O wa gaa bayi o
22/12/2017, 10:41 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Now do you know that libertarianism has made choice so "powerful" and important than any other thing?

Why do we have altcoins?

Remember that Eth and a crypto currency was formed because they felt the could do better and run better project on the network than bitcoin? Same with others
22/12/2017, 10:42 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Ok guys look at this
22/12/2017, 10:42 am - Chijioke: The illusion of freedom
22/12/2017, 10:43 am - Chijioke: Democracy begets Capitalism
22/12/2017, 10:43 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Calm down my brother
22/12/2017, 10:43 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: <Media omitted>
22/12/2017, 10:43 am - Chijioke: Go on
22/12/2017, 10:43 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Tell this to the Internet
22/12/2017, 10:44 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Tell to the Catholic priest and system when at some point it was only them and the government that could run printing press
22/12/2017, 10:44 am - Chijioke: The invention that has always been centralised and has now been fully centralised?
22/12/2017, 10:45 am - Chijioke: I'm not sure I understand what you mean here?
22/12/2017, 10:45 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Tell this to the orthodox guys who didn't have access to the bible until Martin Luther began a revolution
22/12/2017, 10:45 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Ok let's do some history recap here
22/12/2017, 10:47 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: It was because of a "centralized" system printing press couldn't be owned by individuals except the government and the Catholic system...this made individuals read only what that saw as they couldn't edit or let alone access printing equipment
22/12/2017, 10:47 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: No choice in the real sense is bondage
22/12/2017, 10:48 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: This is what is affecting the fiat system today
22/12/2017, 10:48 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: That money keeps depreciating and the common man on the street has no option
22/12/2017, 10:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: That your government keeps gathering loan all in the name of economic for our unborn children to pay up
22/12/2017, 10:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Kindly let me finish 😄
22/12/2017, 10:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm going somewhere
22/12/2017, 10:50 am - Chijioke: Lmao! My man you need to do a lot of reading o
22/12/2017, 10:50 am - Chijioke: Don't let this White people play you
22/12/2017, 10:50 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Programmer in the house this is for you 😋
22/12/2017, 10:50 am - Chijioke: Which is better a government controlled press or an individual controlled press
22/12/2017, 10:50 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Brother make I land small na 😔
22/12/2017, 10:51 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Obviously individuals na
22/12/2017, 10:51 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Now let me bring the idea of price analysis to the fur here
22/12/2017, 10:51 am - Chijioke: Today in America just 6 corporations control what 95% of Americans listen to, read and watch
22/12/2017, 10:52 am - Chijioke: Do you see the illusion of freedom in this?
22/12/2017, 10:52 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: The fact that it is no one means a lot
22/12/2017, 10:53 am - Chijioke: This 6 corporations merely control and own organisations that own other organisations that in turn run several diverse news outlets
22/12/2017, 10:53 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: The fact that another company that has the ability to spring up by whatever means provided they have the necessary backing to do so is good
22/12/2017, 10:53 am - Chijioke: What do you mean no one? Those 6 companies boil down to just about 42 individual
22/12/2017, 10:53 am - Chijioke: *s
22/12/2017, 10:54 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: *not one
22/12/2017, 10:54 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: *not one
22/12/2017, 10:54 am - Chijioke: This is Solidity, Ethereum's programming language for creating Tokens
22/12/2017, 10:54 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Can I talk sir?
22/12/2017, 10:55 am - Chijioke: Those 42 individuals may be part of an organization/party or even cult!!!
22/12/2017, 10:55 am - Chijioke: KKK has over 1 million members
22/12/2017, 10:55 am - Chijioke: So can you see the illusion of freedom?
22/12/2017, 10:56 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Why? Simply because the have the necessary backing na
22/12/2017, 10:56 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: You're get my point
22/12/2017, 10:56 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: We are not even making sense yet 😄
22/12/2017, 10:56 am - Chijioke: Ghaddafi actually pointed this problem out very vividly, that if an individual or individual group owns the media, then the views held in the press are those of that individual or group
22/12/2017, 10:56 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: You have the floor...go ahead sir
22/12/2017, 10:57 am - Chijioke: Which smelling backing is that one
22/12/2017, 10:57 am - Chijioke: That 308million people will be perpetually mind controlled by 42 men
22/12/2017, 10:58 am - Chijioke: Let's revert back to economics discussion and the failure of Bitcoin
22/12/2017, 10:58 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Shall I continue sir?
22/12/2017, 10:59 am - Chijioke: Go ahead
22/12/2017, 10:59 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Thanks 😊
22/12/2017, 10:59 am - Chijioke: Hold on
22/12/2017, 10:59 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Alright
22/12/2017, 10:59 am - Chijioke: Please let's refer to facts as we move along
22/12/2017, 10:59 am - Chijioke: Cause you are yet to counter anything I've said
22/12/2017, 11:00 am - Chijioke: I've told you that libertarianism has created vast inequality and poverty, and you said "freedom of choice", this is an illusion, so let's just refer to facys
22/12/2017, 11:00 am - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: This convo though 

I feel like an illiterate right now😪😪
22/12/2017, 11:00 am - Chijioke: Go on
22/12/2017, 11:02 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: And then I'm trying to tell you what's obtainable in the crypto space and you say, I'm not making any point? What blew up libertarianism if not cryptocurrency?

Perhaps you need to calm down sir
22/12/2017, 11:02 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let start from here
22/12/2017, 11:02 am - Chijioke: But that can't possibly be correct
22/12/2017, 11:03 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: What?
22/12/2017, 11:03 am - Chijioke: Cryptocurrency is just 8 years old
22/12/2017, 11:03 am - Chijioke: Libertarianism is over a century years old
22/12/2017, 11:03 am - Chijioke: So crypto hasn't blown anything up
22/12/2017, 11:04 am - Chijioke: It is in itself libertarian so unless when it destroys itself can't be said to have destroyed libertarianism
22/12/2017, 11:04 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: So why do you think and bring libertarianism to play when we talk crypto?
22/12/2017, 11:05 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Ok let use a lay man's language and probably not libertarianism
22/12/2017, 11:05 am - Chijioke: To show that it uses the same economic system they claim they want financial independence from
22/12/2017, 11:05 am - Chijioke: Ok
22/12/2017, 11:05 am - Chijioke: Crony capitalism
22/12/2017, 11:06 am - Chijioke: Extremely layman language would be *laissez-faire*
22/12/2017, 11:06 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I keep asking how has the government help the money or financial system no good response
22/12/2017, 11:06 am - Chijioke: But let's stick with this
22/12/2017, 11:07 am - Chijioke: It hasn't
22/12/2017, 11:07 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I bring practical instances you they don't relate
22/12/2017, 11:07 am - Chijioke: At least not in a way in which it positively affects the whole nation
22/12/2017, 11:07 am - Chijioke: But so can be said for Bitcoin and it's heading in a direction where it won't
22/12/2017, 11:07 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Mind this same crypto system was born out of the 2008 world's financial crisis sir
22/12/2017, 11:08 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: To simply solve a problem
22/12/2017, 11:08 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: One of the questions we'd ask ourselves is
22/12/2017, 11:08 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: How has this problem been gradually solved so far?
22/12/2017, 11:08 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let's go straight to the point
22/12/2017, 11:09 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Note that this is basically a tussle better fiat currency and digital currency( programmable money)
22/12/2017, 11:10 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: If we keep saying illusion or scam which then is the real illusion?
22/12/2017, 11:10 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let's be factual
22/12/2017, 11:10 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: We're talking about wealth sovereignty
22/12/2017, 11:10 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: We are talking about technology here
22/12/2017, 11:11 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Remember this same technology is what is graduating invading the financial system
22/12/2017, 11:12 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: This is why the government's doesn't fully have the power over technology as it were
22/12/2017, 11:12 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Take for instance
22/12/2017, 11:12 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: We used to use nitel services before the gsm system came
22/12/2017, 11:12 am - Chijioke: He was working on it long before that
22/12/2017, 11:12 am - Chijioke: Since 2006 I think
22/12/2017, 11:12 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: The was as problem a solution was proffered
22/12/2017, 11:13 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Even way before then...we had always had this thing in existence
22/12/2017, 11:13 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Satoshi only only made it more practical by fully inventing it
22/12/2017, 11:14 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: We used to have the postal service, email invaded it what happened? Tech
22/12/2017, 11:14 am - Chijioke: The fact remains it is going in a very negative direction
22/12/2017, 11:14 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: This is were we now need to get ourselves informed
22/12/2017, 11:14 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: And now conclude
22/12/2017, 11:15 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: If you don't like the system then come up with a solution rather that going back to an already failed fiat currency system this is where wisdom lies
22/12/2017, 11:16 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm trying to make a point here
22/12/2017, 11:16 am - Chijioke: The underlying intent - financial independence, exclusion from government markets, wealth sovereignty are positive things, but gradually everyone watched volatility, schemes/scams and hyperdeflation ridicule it,
It has FAILED!!!
22/12/2017, 11:16 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm still coming back to your uninteresting claims
22/12/2017, 11:17 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: 🤦‍♂
22/12/2017, 11:17 am - Chijioke: You know I really like that you said this, after the Wall Street crash of 08 where did everyone run to?
22/12/2017, 11:18 am - Chijioke: Is it not the same government that they despised that bailed them out?
22/12/2017, 11:18 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Crypto was and has always been the better alternative
22/12/2017, 11:19 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: @2348179222327 you probably don't want to be factual here
22/12/2017, 11:19 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let me make my points please
22/12/2017, 11:19 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: You've provided uninteresting claims that are grave to humanity 😂
22/12/2017, 11:21 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: The point is in a free market/decentralized system the fact that anything is obtainable is where the beauty lies
22/12/2017, 11:21 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm explain
22/12/2017, 11:21 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'd explain
22/12/2017, 11:22 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Prior to this time, bitcoin was the only crypto
22/12/2017, 11:22 am - Chijioke: I'm the only one that has been giving facts here, you are yet to give any
22/12/2017, 11:22 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Why did we have other cryptos?
22/12/2017, 11:23 am - Chijioke: Yes, cryptocurrency given what it claims to stand for is a better alternative, but in reality we are seeing the exact opposite
22/12/2017, 11:23 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: What facts please? That do not tally?
22/12/2017, 11:23 am - Chijioke: Bitcoin is NOT a currency
22/12/2017, 11:23 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: How? Let's start with that
22/12/2017, 11:23 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Ok good
22/12/2017, 11:24 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Then I ask what then is a currency?
22/12/2017, 11:24 am - Chijioke: Lmao, what is obtainable with Bitcoin please?  🤣🤣🤣
22/12/2017, 11:26 am - Chijioke: From Wikipedia, "A currency, in the most specific use of the word, refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange"
22/12/2017, 11:27 am - Babajide Martins: A British mansion was recently auctioned
Accepting bitcoins only
22/12/2017, 11:28 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: That is open for improvement everyday...come on!

You laugh an investment/currency that has stood the test of time and been more resilient in the face of challenges now this is ignorance
22/12/2017, 11:28 am - Chijioke: From Wikipedia, "A medium of exchange is an intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system."
22/12/2017, 11:28 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Bitcoin is way more than a currency mind you
22/12/2017, 11:28 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: It's a financial system
22/12/2017, 11:28 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Financial revil3
22/12/2017, 11:28 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: *revolution
22/12/2017, 11:29 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Go tell the banks and government this
22/12/2017, 11:29 am - Chijioke: Thousands of mansions have been sold accepting only US Fed bonds/Wall Street Bank securiteies
22/12/2017, 11:29 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: The fact that your banks lord over your money and make themselves rich is what you pride in?
22/12/2017, 11:30 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Dude limiting bitcoin to just a currency is in the first place MYOPIC
22/12/2017, 11:30 am - Chijioke: I'm not defending any bank/financial system
22/12/2017, 11:30 am - Chijioke: I'm stating pure truth here
22/12/2017, 11:31 am - Chijioke: And this is where you all missed it
22/12/2017, 11:31 am - Chika Nels: 👌🏼
22/12/2017, 11:31 am - Chijioke: That mindset converted Bitcoin to a commodity
22/12/2017, 11:31 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: For the first time in decades money/value can be sent with a third party and you aren't happy with this?
22/12/2017, 11:32 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: A financial system is challenging the status quo and you say it's a failure
22/12/2017, 11:32 am - Chijioke: Ohhhhhhhhhh
22/12/2017, 11:32 am - Chika Nels: RIDE ON GREAT MEN!!!
YOUR ARGUMENT HAS BEEN ENLIGHTENING SO FAR😎😎😎
22/12/2017, 11:32 am - Chijioke: All this peer to peer talk baffles me
22/12/2017, 11:32 am - Chijioke: Is it because most of you lack technical insight
22/12/2017, 11:32 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Now I need to catch up with my 2pm flight
22/12/2017, 11:33 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: We talk later guys
22/12/2017, 11:33 am - Chika Nels changed the subject from "e-Learn Hub" to "e-Learning📝"
22/12/2017, 11:33 am - Chijioke: How is there no intermediary in a Bitcoin transaction?
22/12/2017, 11:33 am - Chijioke: Explain that???
22/12/2017, 11:33 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Don't say this sir
22/12/2017, 11:33 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: How is this there an intermediary????
22/12/2017, 11:34 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: <Media omitted>
22/12/2017, 11:34 am - Chijioke: A system that has miners, wherein the whole system fails/or at least your transactions fail if those miners - who are indeed third parties to transactions, refuse to accept your transaction?Does this sound like peer to peer to you?
22/12/2017, 11:35 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Brother, make I no miss my flight bikonu 😂😂😂
22/12/2017, 11:35 am - Chijioke: Listen to me, nothing, I mean, NOTHING!, that crosses any Ocean on earth is peer to peer
22/12/2017, 11:36 am - Chijioke: If you can disprove this present evidence
22/12/2017, 11:36 am - Chijioke: One google search will however enlighten you!
22/12/2017, 11:36 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I dey go baff
22/12/2017, 11:39 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Tell BLOKCHAIN this...haba!
22/12/2017, 11:39 am - Chijioke: All you can say it is largely decentralised and no one party has a large control, and that will be fine and true for cryptocurrencies in general (bitcoin,ethereum has a centralised network of miners), but that it is peer to peer(meaning entirely decentralized) is just false
22/12/2017, 11:39 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Do you know what the blockchain technology is?
22/12/2017, 11:39 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Not this is looking like you're spilling ignorance sir
22/12/2017, 11:39 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Biko
22/12/2017, 11:40 am - Chijioke: Do you understand the technical aspect of this?
22/12/2017, 11:40 am - Chijioke: I mean, at all
22/12/2017, 11:40 am - Chijioke: If something is peer to peer, it can't be intercepted by a third party o
22/12/2017, 11:40 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Yes I do to a large extent
22/12/2017, 11:40 am - Chijioke: Except for MITM attacks anyways but still, it is just privy to the 2 peers
22/12/2017, 11:41 am - Chijioke: Maybe you should read the source code
22/12/2017, 11:41 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Bro I wish we could continue but, na time cause am
22/12/2017, 11:41 am - Chijioke: Or at least a YouTube illustration
22/12/2017, 11:42 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Is blockchain technology peer to peer...YES OR NO?
22/12/2017, 11:42 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Let me know where you're spilling ignorance sir

22/12/2017, 11:43 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Bitcoin is Peer to Peer based on the decentralized nature and technology sir
22/12/2017, 11:44 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: My sincere apologies if it may seem hard
22/12/2017, 11:44 am - Chijioke: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1819333.0
22/12/2017, 11:44 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: But you coming to tell me bitcoin isn't peer to peer, you just lost is sir
22/12/2017, 11:45 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I've seen this already sir
22/12/2017, 11:45 am - Babajide Martins: Adjusts glasses*.
It's fine
22/12/2017, 11:45 am - Chijioke: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/problems-associated-with-bitcoin-mining-centralization-may-be-overstated-1474917259/
22/12/2017, 11:46 am - Chijioke: http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/07/21/bitcoin-become-centralized
22/12/2017, 11:47 am - Chijioke: It's intended to be, attempts to achieve this through cryptographic approaches given MITM attacks of Intelligence agencies, but the implementation that has miners violated it's principles
22/12/2017, 11:48 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Brother all their claims are always that it's expensive to mine hence it's centralized...which is very funny 😂😂😂😂
22/12/2017, 11:48 am - Chijioke: But it's true
22/12/2017, 11:48 am - Chijioke: That's how power is kept and reserved for the few in a society - money!
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - Chijioke: You cannot mine bitcoin anywhere in Africa successfully
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: And even the so called centralization is in terms of hash power
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Have you heard of the latest mining machine?
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - Chijioke: The electricity consumption is just something else
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I can't remember the name
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Now
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I need to dig that up
22/12/2017, 11:49 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Very true
22/12/2017, 11:50 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: And this why China has the largest mining farm
22/12/2017, 11:50 am - Chijioke: Antminer s9?
22/12/2017, 11:50 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: No joor
22/12/2017, 11:50 am - Chijioke: That's mainly what's pissing many white people off
22/12/2017, 11:50 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I'm running late guys
22/12/2017, 11:50 am - Chijioke: They see the power as being in Chinese hands
22/12/2017, 11:51 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Biko we can continue this later
22/12/2017, 11:51 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Because the government policy favours them? I mean miners common
22/12/2017, 11:52 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Why won't I pitch my farm there if it'd favour me?
22/12/2017, 11:52 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Haba, I can't run a business at loss na, I'd rather not embark on it 😂
22/12/2017, 11:52 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: I need to stop here
22/12/2017, 11:52 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: But I definitely love to continue after
22/12/2017, 11:53 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: @2348179222327 I love you bro 😄🤝

22/12/2017, 11:54 am - Chijioke: A change in machine equipment won't matter, cause Bitcoin has a machine learning code, where it adjust it's difficulty level to ensure that each block is found in 10 minutes, so basically, bitcoin is capable of straining the World's fastest computers
22/12/2017, 11:54 am - Chijioke: Yh, when you are back we can continue

22/12/2017, 1:56 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I once took time and energy to explain to @2348167141023 that BitCoin is not 100% immune to government policies especially the Chinese government but he negates
22/12/2017, 1:59 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Now this...

Please how has these proven your point?
Fiat can be controlled using monetary policy while this environment you say favours miners is controlled using fiscal policies so is BitCoin independent of the government and How's it independence and providing equality
22/12/2017, 2:00 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Also, the notion that BitCoin helped the 08 recession is absolutely wrong - government bailouts were the way out....
22/12/2017, 2:01 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: And if you say you don't want government,you end up in the hands of crooked capitalists so I think @2348167141023 should accept facts and the truth about BitCoin and be smart with his investments
22/12/2017, 2:02 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I'm not against BitCoin but I am saying it's not an alternative to fiat and also has failed as a project
22/12/2017, 2:02 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Kudos @2348179222327 for the facts and further enlightenments
22/12/2017, 2:11 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: You call it delusion, I laugh 😂
22/12/2017, 2:12 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: That policies favour a particular business or doesn't mean the government is in control na...nawa o
22/12/2017, 2:13 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Ask Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Japan, Brazil
22/12/2017, 2:14 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Bitcoin at when bitcoin was $10k it was been spent at over $12k in Zimbabwe to help/boost their economic system, if I'm wrong go check sir
22/12/2017, 2:15 pm - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Why is bitcoin being legalized in Japan?

22/12/2017, 3:14 pm - Abayo: [02:32, 12/22/2017] Ben Adjei: Dubai is planning to remove middlemen like lawyers, accountants, bankers, immigration officers & govt. officials by year 2020 by adapting to blockchain technology. 😱 

What will governments look like 5 years from now? Today Dubai announced its plan to be “The World’s first blockchain powered government” with a plan to move 100% on blockchain by 2020:

> ArabianChain is moving all Dubai’s government paperwork onto the blockchain, so it doesn’t need lawyers and government departments for verification.

> ObjectTech is providing digital passports and blockchain security to Dubali International airport to deliver seamless entry and exit from the country.

> The Dubai Land Department has launched a blockchain system to record all real estate contracts and record all property-related transactions such as rental, utility and telcom bills.

> In October, Dubai launched emCash, its own cryptocurrecny for citizens to pay for all services via digital cash.

> The country has set up the 46-member Global Blockchain Council, including companies like Microsoft, IBM and Cisco, to lead the way in the country’s adoption of blockchain technology.

Blockchain smart contracts and cryptocurrency track all transactions that take place with any agreement or transferable asset. That means the end-point of Dubai’s blockchain adoption is that there will be no further need for the middlemen in our day-to-day transactions.

No more laywers. 

No more accountants. 

No more bankers. 

No more immigration officers. 

No more government officials. 

Dubai estimates that by putting its 100 million documents each year onto the blockchain, they will save 25 million man hours and $1.5 billion in tax dollars. 

It would also massively shrink the size of the Dubai government. Why would they do that?

As Dr Aisha Bin Bishr, Director General of Smart Dubai Office, the country’s department in charge of making Dubai the world’s smartest city says:

“The Dubai government differs from others around the world in that it aims to make Dubai the ‘Happiest City on Earth’. In short, we want to give people back time they would have otherwise spent on filing paperwork.”

Could Dubai’s Blockchain initiative lead to a revolution in happy countries reducing the size and influence of their goverhments? 

Could an end point be no government at all?

“The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.” ~ Bill Gates

When asked how he would set up a government on Mars, Elon Musk said the “Most likely the form of government on Mars would be a direct democracy - it would be people voting directly on issues.”

In other words, in this new technological age where the best middle man is no middle man, the best government may be no government at all.” - Roger Hamilton

22/12/2017, 3:15 pm - Chijioke: 👊🏾
22/12/2017, 3:18 pm - Chijioke: The funny thing is: this is a repetition of history and we know how this went in the Dutch Golden Age
22/12/2017, 3:19 pm - Chijioke: Is Bitcoin no longer using the internet? If yes, then how is it that you believe governments cannot clamp down on it
22/12/2017, 3:19 pm - Chijioke: Try and be objective
22/12/2017, 3:20 pm - Chijioke: If governments shut down all servers operating cryptocurrency isn't this a setback for a Bitcoin and also evidence that it's not entirely independent
22/12/2017, 3:21 pm - Chijioke: Bitcoin like Democracy is something for an ideal planet, something that assumes humans will always act right and in the interest of the collective
22/12/2017, 3:21 pm - Chijioke: But we have history to tell that seldom ever happens
22/12/2017, 5:18 pm - Chisom: So we also need a decentralised internet
22/12/2017, 5:36 pm - Mosad: Isn't that what the deep and dark web are trying to achieve?
22/12/2017, 5:52 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I think these people don't understand how much energy is consumed by the Bitcoin accumulation or the emission in a world clamouring for green economy

22/12/2017, 5:54 pm - Chijioke: Governments/Activists are already using this as a pretext to a proposed ban
22/12/2017, 5:55 pm - Chijioke: It's quite easy though
22/12/2017, 5:55 pm - Chijioke: A guy did, decentralized supercomputer, on Ethereum
22/12/2017, 5:55 pm - Chisom: Not exactly
22/12/2017, 5:55 pm - Chijioke: And it presents a solution to a problem
22/12/2017, 5:56 pm - Chijioke: Although what's the benefit of a decentralized internet to a profit-driven World?
22/12/2017, 5:57 pm - Chijioke: Besides I believe it is necessary for governments to be able to control information to a certain extent, and a decentralized internet will defeat that.
22/12/2017, 5:57 pm - Chijioke: I saw a documentary on Aljazeera where Whatsapp was used by bad actors to spread false information in India that got a Household burned alive
22/12/2017, 5:58 pm - Chijioke: So decentralisation may not be too good, perhaps a rules-baded centralised internet
22/12/2017, 5:58 pm - Chijioke: *rules-based
22/12/2017, 6:54 pm - Chisom: Bitcoin cash just dropped to $0

22/12/2017, 6:55 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Times 10 later.
22/12/2017, 7:02 pm - Chijioke: Just look at this
22/12/2017, 7:02 pm - Chijioke: Did it rise again?
22/12/2017, 7:02 pm - Chisom: I think it was a glitch
22/12/2017, 7:02 pm - Chisom: Because it didn't reach 5 minutes
22/12/2017, 7:02 pm - Chijioke: So it never fell at all?
22/12/2017, 7:04 pm - Chisom: Could be
22/12/2017, 7:04 pm - Chisom: I only checked Coinbase

23/12/2017, 9:20 am - Chika Nels: In 1896, Thomas Edison, the great inventor who invented the electric bulb, was working on an idea to design a car when he heard that a young man who worked in  his company had created an experimental car. 

Edison met the youngman at his company's party in New York and interviewed him about the car. He was impressed! 

He had the same idea as the young man but he was considering electricity as the power source while the young man used a gasoline engine to power the car. He slammed his fist down and shouted "young man, that's the thing! You have it! I think you are on to something! I encourage you to continue your pursuits!" 

With these words of encouragement from the most highly respected inventor in the United States at that time, HENRY Ford continued his work, invented a car and became wealthy.

On december 9, 1914, Thomas Edison's laboratory and factory got burnt. He was 67years old and the damage was too extensive for insurance cover. Before the ashes were cold, Henry Ford handed Edison a cheque of $750,000 with a note saying that Edison could have more if he needed it!

In 1916, Henry Ford relocated his home to the building next to Edison's home and when Edison couldn't walk and was confined to a wheelchair by his doctors, Henry Ford also bought himself a wheelchair so that he could run wheelchair races with his friend and mentor! 

Thomas Edison made Henry Ford believe in himself and got a friend for life!

Don't ever be jealous of other people's success. If you can't win a race, help the person in front of you break the record! 

Putting out the candle light of your neighbour in the dark will never increase the brightness of yours.

Your candle will not lose its light when it lights up another candle. Getting the job done is more important than who gets the glory!

Be inspired, speak positively into someone's life today, and possibly save a soul.

Ben Carson.
23/12/2017, 9:23 am - Akolab: Thomas never invented the electric bulb, he created a version that lasted long and as the great entrepreneur he was, he sold so much of it, people generally assumed he was the creator of the light bulb
23/12/2017, 9:24 am - Akolab: Nice read though 😊😊😊
23/12/2017, 9:24 am - Akanni Hafeez: Lesson learnt! Thanks man.

23/12/2017, 9:29 am - Akolab: Am just clearing this myths jàre. Truthfully not a fan of Edison, Tesla till take over 😍😍😍
23/12/2017, 9:32 am - Chika Nels: Lol I know 😅 thanks for that👍🏼

23/12/2017, 10:01 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: True..👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
But unfortunately only the academic knows how great Tesla was... Most people rate Edison over him
23/12/2017, 10:01 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
23/12/2017, 10:08 am - Babajide Martins: Cos academically speaking, Edison is greater.

Telsa is only great at ideas and using his money to drive the best personnels to achieve that
23/12/2017, 10:18 am - Chika Nels: Indeed they were 2 great men. 
We too shall be great people one day.
23/12/2017, 10:22 am - ‪+234 816 714 1023‬: Why would you talk like this? Government clamping down on the Internet you mean??? Hahahaha...then the government is doomed! 😂
23/12/2017, 10:22 am - Babajide Martins: Pls not today..
Not now..
23/12/2017, 10:23 am - Babajide Martins: U guys can take it to private chat..😔😒

23/12/2017, 10:36 am - Chijioke: China, U.S did it to certain websites, this is a fact not a probability
Also read about the *Great Firewall of China* so you'll understand they don't need to shut down the whole internet, just specific domains and ips, frankly US has the most effective method: one court order, one phone call to internet providers/domain name server(not domain hosting providers, they bypass that entirely)
23/12/2017, 10:37 am - Chijioke: Then you'll see an FBI/DHS logo on when you visit your domain and that's it, you're down!!!
23/12/2017, 10:37 am - Chijioke: It happened to www.btc-e.com
23/12/2017, 10:37 am - Chijioke: You should know this
23/12/2017, 10:38 am - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: Pls guys, can we minimise the rate of arguments on this group? Turned on my data to more than 500 chats on Bitcoin arguments yesterday. I know that's what we get for putting lots of great minds together in 1 place but guys plssss🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
23/12/2017, 10:38 am - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: We had a lecture on cryptocurrency already. If we are not clear, we can PM individuals involved.

23/12/2017, 10:51 am - Akolab: Tesla was never about the money, he was a genius fam, he made over 100 inventions and had the highest no of patents, he could have been a billionaire if he wanted to, he gave out most of his patents free
23/12/2017, 10:52 am - Babajide Martins: Read what I wrote again
23/12/2017, 10:54 am - Akolab: Edison was not greater, he lost the battle of Currents 😌
23/12/2017, 10:54 am - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Edison was more of an entrepreneur than a scientist and he consistently battled to place his name higher than Tesla's

If you've seen the series "the men who built America" you'd know this
23/12/2017, 10:55 am - Babajide Martins: 🙈
Asweeaar..I've been saying nonsense since.

Tesla made me think of Elon Musk
23/12/2017, 10:55 am - Babajide Martins: Tesla is greater biko 😅😂🤣
23/12/2017, 10:55 am - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: Yeah he tried to paint Tesla's AC as destructive but he failed
23/12/2017, 10:56 am - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: But he never got the fame he deserved
23/12/2017, 10:58 am - Akolab: My point exactly
23/12/2017, 10:59 am - Akolab: I was shocked when I found out he was first to use radio waves to remotely control a boat and even X-rays
23/12/2017, 11:00 am - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: He has hundreds of low key inventions
23/12/2017, 11:00 am - Tosin Lawal: Tesla was a mad inventor
23/12/2017, 11:00 am - Tosin Lawal: Edison was a popular inventor

23/12/2017, 11:07 am - Babajide Martins: The Nigerian civil war.
If only it was taught extensively in history...this new generation of ibos would understand what unity means and learn from the mistakes there fathers made.

Instead we have an entire generation that know little about it. Some just heard from their parents, some had to read "foreign books" 
You can imagine my cousin first heard about Biafra when she was abroad in history of African studies back in high school...like damn...🤦🏿‍♂


But yea, as we were saying Tesla na demigod.

What about Newton my guy...😎😎😎
23/12/2017, 11:10 am - Akolab: Newton that ruined college for us with his stupid calculus 😑

Religion stepped in the way of science. A whole lot. The only time science and religion merged were in their so called  holy wars. The most irritating of them all was the scuffle for Jerusalem.

Got into their heads
23/12/2017, 12:51 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: Friedman: I have five pieces of advice for my daughters. My first rule is: Always think like an immigrant, because we’re all new immigrants to the age of accelerations.

Second, always think like an artisan. Always do your job in a way that you bring so much empathy to it, so much unique, personal value-add that it cannot be automated, digitized, or outsourced, and you want to carve your initials into it at the end of the day.

Third, always be in beta. Always think of yourself as if you need to be re-engineered, retooled, relearned, and retaught constantly. Never think of yourself as finished—otherwise, you really will be finished.

Fourth, always remember that PQ (passion quotient) plus CQ (curiosity quotient) is greater than IQ (intelligence quotient). Give me a young person with a high PQ and a high CQ, and I will take that person over a kid with a high IQ seven days a week.

And last, whatever you do, whether you’re in the public sector or the private sector, whether you’re on the front lines or a manager, always think entrepreneurially. Always think, “Where can I fork off and start a new company over here, a new business over there?” Because a huge manufacturing company is not coming to your town with a 25,000-person factory. That factory is now 2,500 robots and 500 people. So we need three people starting jobs for six; six people starting jobs for 12; 12 people starting jobs for 20. That’s how we’re going to get all those jobs. We need everyone thinking entrepreneurially.

From the Peace Project album!


Arrival

Words and Music by Michael Guy Chislett, Matt Crocker, Benjamin Hastings & Dylan Thomas

VERSE 1
Who is God that He would take our frame
The artisan inside the paint
Or breathe the very air His breath sustains
The architect inside the plan

CHORUS
Oh come now hail His arrival
The God of creation
Royalty robed in the flesh He created
Jesus the maker has made Himself known
All hail the infinite infant God

VERSE 2
The One who had no start and knows no end
Became confined in time and tense
The Everlasting God
The Great I Am
In the mercy of a mother’s hands

BRIDGE
The One who holds the stars
In the creases of His hands
Is the One who holds my heart
Like a mother once held him
The One who knows what lies
Where space has run its course
Embraced a baby’s mind
And now I can know my God
The monarch of the stars
The King above all kings
The ruler of my heart
And the Saviour for my sins
The One who sees what lies
In each and every soul
Embraced our finite eyes
And now we can see our God

VERSE 3
The holy Word of God defined by name
The author climbed inside the page

BRIDGE 2
God embraced our frame
When He graced the world He made
All hail the divine in a manger
Love embraced our fate
When the playwright took the stage
All hail the arrival of our maker
All hail the arrival of our Saviour
All hail the arrival of our maker

25/12/2017, 8:15 pm - Ede: It is not surprising that Nigerians in the youth demographic are heavily involved in betting. The poll states that 60 million people within this age range are into betting and gambling. This is not surprising. Nigeria is a football crazy country that has a huge youth population.

The poll results reveal why Nigerians bet on football games weekly. 30% of the people who took the poll said they gamble because it is a way to make quick money. 21% said it was because of the high rate of unemployment. 15% said it was for greed and other reasons.

26/12/2017, 7:41 am - Akolab: Many years ago, it was  raining heavily in Philadelphia U.S.A .
An elderly man and his wife entered the lobby of a small hotel. The couple approached the front desk clerk " could you possibly give us a room here "?

The Clark was a friendly man with a winning smile . He explained to the couple that there were three conventions in town, he said "all of our rooms are filled, but I can't send a nice couple like you out into the rain at One o o'clock in the morning ",Would you like to sleep in my room ,it's not exactly a suit, but it will be good enough to make you comfortable for the night ".....

Then the couple agreed to sleep in the Clark's room.... The next morning when the elderly man was paying the bill, he said to the Clark "You are a very kind man,  you are suitable to be the manager of the best hotel"...."Maybe someday I will build One for you"
The clerk looked at the elderly Couple and smiled... the  three of them had a good laugh.... 

Two years passed, the clerk had almost forgotten the incident .
One day, he received a letter from the elderly man, he asked the clerk to pay a friendly visit to New York City .....
The elderly man met the clerk in New York City and led him to the corner of fifth Avenue and 34th street. 
Then he pointed to a great new building there " That is the hotel,  I have just built for you to manage "
"you must be joking "said the  young man. 

I'm sure, I am not joking, from today onwards you will be the manager of this hotel" said the older man, a smile playing around his mouth ...

The older man's name was William Waldorf Aster,  and that Magnificent Structure was the World's famous, costliest  and Luxurious "Waldorf Astoria Hotel " The young clerk who became it 's first manager  was George C. Boltd. 

Reflection : We underestimate  the power of our friendliness, our smile, our touch, our small help, kind word, small act of caring. ..But really they touch many hearts.. .One day, they can change our lives....

26/12/2017, 11:48 am - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: The guy said she ain't matured enof. But it's a lie he found love in his office
26/12/2017, 11:48 am - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: As far as your quest is not an hidden agenda and you did not play apart in their break up then u may proceed.
However , remember that if you cannot comfortably tallk about the relationship or flaunt the relationship in the presence of your friend.. Then you may as well have been doing the wrong thing.  That is where the issue of conscience and morality comes.
26/12/2017, 11:50 am - ‪+234 816 005 4419‬: Den push ahead
26/12/2017, 11:51 am - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: 👊🏾 you have answered my question. I can flaunt her but I'm scared it will create a very big wall between us and our friends
26/12/2017, 11:58 am - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: If you have that inner satisfaction then you speak to your friends about your new interest in all truthfulness.
But if you are feeling scared then you may need to perish the thought of dating her.
But let me say that you may need to ask your self the following questions
How close are you to these your friends?
What value do they play in your life?
How long have u being friends?
Would you be comfortable for life with having a resenting face come in between your friends?
Does this girl in question make u happy?
Have u tried to size her pysche to no she isn't playing games to disrupt your friendship?

26/12/2017, 12:03 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: Morally, i see nothing wrong with dating your friend's ex. Firstly, you are not related. Secondly, you didn't play a role in their break-up. Thirdly, she will end up with someone else and if you love her that much, why cant the person be you? If you genuinely love her and she feels the same and doesn't mind the initial frown of dissatisfaction from people then go ahead. But make sure the feelings are genuine both parts. Also a lot of factors will make it awkward. Factors like how close your relationship is with your friend(s), and those other questions @2348088046609 asked. Then CRITICALLY, pls find out why they broke up very well and be sure that you can cope with the issues they used to have or you will also repeat their history
26/12/2017, 12:03 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: I know right?
26/12/2017, 12:04 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: We've all been friends since undergrad days. Our circle is like a family 2 guys married 2 of the gehs. 
Well I don't think she is playing games. We weren't very "close" before until we both had to work on a project that brought us together for more than 6 hours daily for 2weeks then....

26/12/2017, 12:07 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: I am of the opinion that you also call your friends and tell them of your feelings. If they are truly your friends and they care about you and see that you can both be happy, they will give you their supports and blessings. As long as her ex doesn't feel strongly about her anymore.

26/12/2017, 12:08 pm - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: By strongly i mean positively and negatively oooo. You have to clarify this. And when you have, you can all get together and introduce her newly to everyone to break up any ice.
26/12/2017, 12:11 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: U and your friends should have the heart to heart talk..

29/12/2017, 2:43 pm - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: From a friend:

15 sets of people you must meet in this coming year 2018... 

1.The Encouragers- even in discouraging situations of life, these people keep you going with encouraging words; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

2.The Hand Lifters- They are those whose hands are strong enough to hold yours up when you are weak; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

3.Destiny Helpers- They provide shoulders upon which you ride to fulfilling your dream and destiny; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

4.The Givers- these ones will give of their time, talent, and treasure to you in your hour of need; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

5.The Receivers- these ones are different from routine takers and serial beggars. You can’t be blessed if you don’t give, and you can’t give if there is no one to receive. Not all lands bring forth fruits, and not all hands that receive command blessings. You need those whose receiving hands will trigger abundant blessings unto you; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

6.The Prayer Conquerors- You need more than prayer warriors IN 2018. Many Prayer warriors pray from their heads only; Prayer conquerors pray from their heart and conquer; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

7.The Recommenders- these are the ones who mention your name in quarters where your skills and talents will be celebrated; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

8.The Correctors- these are the ones who honestly tell you when you are wrong; they prevent you from digging a grave of mistakes that may bury your destiny; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

9.The Committed- whether things are up or down, these ones are standing with you; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

10.The Loyal - they work with you with all of their hearts to make things work in your life; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

11.The Truth-Tellers-they will not call night day, and day night; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

12.The Altruists- these ones believe that life is not just about them, it is about you too; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

13.The Reliable- You can count on them when it counts most; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

14.The Contented- these ones are not greedy, they are satisfied with whatever they get from you and they bless you from their heart for it; MAY YOU MEET THEM. 

15. Lovers and Pursuers of God & Godly life- these ones are always connected to God; MAY YOU MEET THEM, so you will never be disconnected from your source who is your MAKER. ETERNAL ROCK OF AGES AND  KING OF KINGS.

Pls take note of this as you  journey unto the new year. 
Surely, you will waste your wasters and laugh your enemies to scorn in Jesus mighty name. Amen

29/12/2017, 11:20 pm - Chika Nels: In lay man terms,  twitter jails you. 
Makes your handle invisible when searched, makes your business tweets(hashtags or related for a brand or individual) invisible.
Certain Restrictions like: not seeing notifications, not seeing tags,  not gaining followers,  or worse like not being able to tweet😂
29/12/2017, 11:20 pm - Chika Nels: Not late dear,  you can still drop.

👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾👇🏾

For those who are not into ICT or do not understand the ethics of the internet, please get this knowledge and hold on to it for your future decisions when people start posting rubbish links telling you to claim one unrealistic gifts

In internet terminologies, we have what is called TLD which stands for Top Level Domain. The TLDs tell you more of the type of website you are visiting for which the domain is standing for. Examples are...
.com which stands for commercial (that's for businesses)
.org for organizations
.net for networks
.edu for education
.mil for military
.gov for government
Etc.

TLDs can also come by being country specific.
Examples are...
.ng for Nigeria
.fr for France
.us for USA
.uk for United Kingdom
Etc.

TLDs can still be matched for its purpose and country specific. Examples...
.com.ng for Nigerian commercial websites
.gov.ng for Nigerian government websites
Etc.

Now when people decide to create a website, they choose a name for their domain and for the purpose of the website, also choose its TLD. Example...
adisfunn.com 
microsoft.com
safe-haven.win
church.net
nta.com.ng
scoan.org
Etc.

Now out of domains, we have what is called subdomain. A subdomain exists as a child of its mother domain. If there is no domain, there will be no subdomain.

A subdomain can exist as a separate website of its own but will always rely on its mother domain to exist. It is always attached to the mother domain. Example...

news.microsoft.com

In the example above,
microsoft is the domain
.com is the TLD for commercial purpose
news is the subdomain

So in clarity, news is the subdomain of microsoft domain existing on the .com TLD for commercial purpose

Subdomain always come from the left side of all links

Just like we have subdomain, we also have sub-subdomain. In this the sub-subdomain relies on the subdomain which in turn relies on the domain. Example...
tech.news.microsoft.com

And then we have more subs of preceding subdomains and so on till when the owner of the website gets tired of creating subs

Always remember that all subs come from the left side of links.

To know the real owner of a link posted, first look at the domain name which is always at the right side of the link

Whatever you see there tells you if the link is original or fake phishing link

Like in the Jumia nonsense link that has been going on, I will analyse it now below

http://jumia.com.ng.new-vouchers.win

The real Jumia website we know is 

Jumia.com.ng

In the posted fake link above, if you look closely, you will see that jumia.com.ng came first in the link from the left side

This tells you that it is a sub sub subdomain of the domain new-vouchers.win

The main website of that link is new-vouchers.win

They created the sub sub subdomain jumia.com.ng to deceive people into thinking they are actually visiting Jumia.com.ng

Remember, always study the links you receive to know the real owner before clicking it.

Rule of thumb, read from the right of every links to know the real domain before clicking

Anything from the left side is just a sub

Now that you have gained this knowledge, share it and stay safe

Thank you
Season's greeting to you all.

31/12/2017, 10:39 pm - Tolulope Shokefun: Sometimes, what you think you want isn't what you need. Learn to identify your needs and channel your energy towards getting it
31/12/2017, 10:44 pm - Tolulope Shokefun: Some friends are in your life to practically weigh you down. They assume to be in a competition with you even when you aren't in one with them. They keep tabs on your life, asking questions but only so that they can beat you at it. You don't need such energy. You enjoy your friendship with them when all is rosy but you know deep down that they aren't healthy for you. It will be hard but cut them out. That's when you'll really find peace.

Bottom line: watch out for people you call your friends. I generally refer to them as Frienemies
31/12/2017, 10:46 pm - Chika Nels: 💯💯..nothing like learning about this. The earlier the better👌🏼
31/12/2017, 10:46 pm - Tolulope Shokefun: Finally, before I go back to worship.......

You are the best version of yourself. Never doubt that you can achieve anything you put your mind to.
2018 will be great for you. You just have to start. You may think it's the wrong step but while on that path, you'll learn and find the right one

02/01/2018, 11:44 am - Chika Nels: *PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI'S NEW YEAR SPEECH* 

"I join my fellow citizens this morning to welcome and celebrate the New Year 2018. This year promises to be pivotal in our quest for CHANGE.

Unfortunately, I am saddened to acknowledge that for many this Christmas and New Year holidays have been anything but merry and happy. Instead of showing love, companionship and charity, some of our compatriots chose this period to inflict severe hardship on us all by creating unnecessary fuel scarcity across the country.

The consequence was that not many could travel and the few who did had to pay exorbitant transport fares. This is unacceptable given that NNPC had taken measures to ensure availability at all depots. I am determined to get to the root of this collective blackmail of all Nigerians and ensure that whichever groups are behind this manipulated hardship will be prevented from doing so again.

Such unpatriotism will not divert the Administration from the course we have set ourselves. Our government’s watch word and policy thrust is CHANGE. We must change our way of doing things or we will stagnate and be left behind in the race to lift our people out of poverty and into prosperity.

My address to fellow Nigerians this morning is devoted mainly to informing you about the intense efforts this Administration is putting to address our country’s huge infrastructural deficit.

We are going to make significant in-roads in advancing road, rail and power projects across the country.

The Ministry of Power, Works and Housing is one of the drivers of this Government’s commitment to renew and increase Nigeria’s stock of infrastructure in order to achieve global economic competitiveness as targeted under the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.

With regards to Railways, we have set ourselves ambitious targets. Already in construction stage is the Lagos-Kano Standard Gauge Railway.

The line should reach Ibadan from Lagos by the end of this year and will carry two million passengers per year and five million tons of cargo will be transported every year giving a substantial boost to the country’s economy.

Construction of the Kano – Kaduna segment is expected to commence this year and reach Kaduna by the end of 2019. By the end of 2021 the two ends will be joined so that we will have standard gauge railway across the main North-South trading route.

The Abuja – Kaduna route will be boosted by additional rolling stock next Thursday and will be able to handle one million commuters annually.

At the same time I have approved and negotiations will be concluded in the first part of this year for the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri line covering Aba, Owerri, Umuahia, Enugu, Awka, Abakaliki, Makurdi, Lafia, Jos, Bauchi, Gombe, Yola and Damaturu. The Abuja to Itakpe line will go through Baro and terminates in Warri with construction of a new seaport at Warri.

Negotiations are also advanced for the construction ofother railway lines, firstly from Kano to Maradi in Niger Republic passing through Kazaure, Daura, Katsina, Jibiato Maradi.

Secondly, Lagos to Calabar the “Coastal Rail” through Ore, Benin, Agbor, Asaba, Onitsha, Sapele, Ughelli, Warri, Yenagoa, Otuoke, Port Harcourt, Aba, Uyo and Calabar. In the next few years, all these Nigerian cities will be linked by functional modern rail systems, giving enormous boost to the social and economic life of our people.

With respect to the Abuja Capital Light Rail, progress has reached 98% completion, as at 64% completion when we assumed office. Only test runs remain before start of operations.

This train service will stimulate economic activities in the Federal Capital and provide residents with an efficient and safe transportation system. Twelve railway sub-stations around the capital over a 45.2 kilometre route will serve as a catalyst and a pull factor to the economy of the area. The Light Rail System will reduce traffic congestion and carbon emission in line with the Administration’s policy on climate change.

Management of the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) has been reconstituted and has been charged with a 12 week rapid intervention in road repairs to cover all the geo-political zones. Government is undertaking repairs and maintenance of 44 roads within the the six geo-political zones.

Twenty five major highways will be funded under the N100b SUKUK facility. Each geo-political zone will benefit by an equal amount of N16.67b. The following major highways are to receive special attention:

a. Oyo – Ogbomosho,

b. Ofusu – Ore – Ajebandele – Shagamu,

c. Yenegoa Road Junction – Kolo Otuoke – Bayelsa Palm,

d. Enugu – Part Harcourt Dual Carrriage Way,

e. Onitsha – Enugu Expressway,

f. Kaduna Eastern Bypass,

g. Dualization of Kano – Maiduguri Road,

h. Dualization of Abuja – Lokoja – Benin Road,

i. Dualization of Suleja – Minna Road.

In addition, Government has approved work to start on the re-construction of Abuja – Kaduna – Zaria – Kano roadwhich is in a state of disrepair. Work will soon start and is expected to be completed in 2019.

More Nigerians across the country are experiencing improved power supply to their homes and businesses. However, power remains a concern to this governmentbecause too many people still do not have regular and reliable supply.

The Payment Assurance Guarantee Scheme which started in January 2016 has enabled the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader to raise so far N701 billion to assure Generation Companies of at least 80% payment for any power delivered to the national grid.

Consequently, generation has now reached 7,000MW. On December 8, 2017 the country achieved 5,155MW of power delivered to consumers, the highest level ever recorded.

Several moribund projects have been revived. Repairs of Afam Power Station added 110MW in 2017 and another 240MW will be added this year through a private investment partnership.

Katsina Power Project is now being tested and producing 10MW of power from wind for the first time in Nigeria. It should be fully operational this year.

The Zungeru 700MW Hydroelectric Power Project, stalled by court cases is due for completion in 2019. The transmission and other requirements to operate the 30MW Gurara Phase 1 Hydroelectric Plant, the 40MW KashinbillaHydroelectric Plant and the 215 MW Kaduna Gas/LPG/Diesel Power Plant will also be completed this year.

A landmark project, Mambilla Hydroelectric Power Project is at last taking off. This project has been on the drawing Board for 40 years, but now the engineering, procurement and construction contract for the 3,050MW project has been agreed with a Chinese joint venture Company with a financing commitment from the government of China. Completion is targeted for 2023.

As I mentioned earlier, the Transmission Company of Nigeria can now distribute all the 7,000MW that can be generated. TCN and the Niger Delta Holding Company have added 1,950MVA of 330 down to 132KV transformer capacity of 10 transmission stations and 2,930MVA of 132 down to 33KV transformer capacity of 42 sub-stations including Ikot Ekpene, Aba, Alagbon, Ajah, Ejigbo, Funtuaand Zaria.​

This Administration is working with the privatised distribution Companies to overcome the continuing challenges of distribution.

These massive public works should spearhead the recovery and lead millions back to employment. You will recall that it was not until last year that we got out of the economic recession into which the country had fallen as a consequence of past unsustainable economic policies which projected short-term illusory growth.

The government is slowly stabilizing the economy.

It was in order to change the steady and steep decline that we adopted the more sustainable policies and programmes captured in the Economic Recovery Plan. Diversification efforts have resulted in improved output particularly in agriculture and solid minerals sectors. The relative exchange rate stability has improved manufacturing sector performance.

We have got to get used to discipline and direction in economic management. The days of business as usual are numbered.

Two years ago I appealed to people to go back to the land. I am highly gratified that agriculture has picked up, contributing to the government’s effort to re-structure the economy. Rice imports will stop this year. Local rice, fresher and more nutritious will be on our dishes from nowon.

By the same token, I am today appealing to enterprising Nigerians with ideas and unemployed graduates and other able-bodied and literate men and women with ideas not to just sit and wait for employment from the government or the Organized Private Sector. Great nations are built by enterprising people who turn their hands to anything that circumstances dictate.

In respect of political developments, I have kept a close watch on the on-going debate about “Restructuring”. No human law or edifice is perfect. Whatever structure we develop must periodically be perfected according to changing circumstances and the country’s socio-economic developments. We Nigerians can be very impatient and want to improve our conditions faster than may be possible considering our resources and capabilities. When all the aggregates of nationwide opinions are considered, my firm view is that our problems are more to do with process than structure.

We tried the Parliamentary system: we jettisoned it. Now there are shrill cries for a return to the Parliamentary structure. In older democracies these systems took centuries to evolve so we cannot expect a copied system to fit neatly our purposes. We must give a long period of trial and improvement before the system we have adopted is anywhere near fit for purpose.

However, there is a strong case for a closer look at the cost of government and for the public services long used to extravagance, waste and corruption to change for the better. I assure you that government is ever receptive to ideas which will improve governance and contribute to the country’s peace and stability.

As the electioneering season approaches politicians must avoid exploiting ethnicity and religion by linking ethnicity with religion and religion with politics. Such must be avoided at all costs if we are to live in harmony.

In this respect the rest of Nigeria could learn from the South Western States who have successfully internalized religion , ethnicity and politics.

Political discourse should be conducted with civility, decorum and in a constitutional manner. We all have a collective responsibility to strengthen our democracy and entrench the rule of law. We should draw encouragement from the series of bye-elections conducted by INEC last year which were generally violence free and their outcomes adjudged to be free and fair.

Before I conclude my address I must reassure my fellow citizens that security of life and property is still top of our government’s agenda. We have since beaten Boko Haram. Isolated attacks still occur, but even the best-policed countries cannot prevent determined criminals from committing terrible acts of terror as we have seen during the past years in Europe, Asia, Middle East, elsewhere in Africa and in America.

Our government remains determined to protect all Nigerians in line with our election pledge and promises.On behalf of all Nigerians let me offer our thanks to the Armed forces, the Police, other para-military forces and traditional authorities who are working round the clock to ensure that you and I go about our normal business in reasonable safety.

Terrorism and urban crimes are world-wide phenomena and our security forces are continuously adapting their responses to changing threats.

With regard to rampant cases of kidnappings, we are taking immediate short-term measures to combat this new evil creeping into our societies. Tighter police methods and swift and severe punishment for those proved to be engaged in kidnapping are on the way.

With respect to Niger Delta, Government is still engaging responsible leadership of the Communities to help in identifying and addressing genuine grievances of the region. Our clean-up programme in collaboration with the United Nations is making satisfactory progress.

I am grateful to all the Governors and other Political &Community leaders of the Niger Delta States for their part in bringing relative peace to the areas.

Finally let me again express my heartfelt thanks to all Nigerians who prayed for me during my illness last year. I feel deeply humbled by your prayers and good wishes and I am more determined than ever to serve you to the best of my ability.

"Good morning. And I wish everyone a Happy New Year.​"

“At the end of World War 1, I was awarded for my bravery after saving a group of my men,” the grandfather says. “You see, we were fighting in northern France and one of our enemies threw a grenade at us. I managed to pick it up and throw it away before it exploded. So right after the war ended, a General gave me a sword, engraved with the words ‘Awarded for Bravery and Valor, A True Hero, World War 1’.”

08/01/2018, 11:53 am - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: In 1998, Kodak had 170,000 employees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide.  Within just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt.
Interestingly the inventor of digital photography in 1975  Steven Sasson worked for Kodak but Kodak ignored the new technology and in the process ignored their future!!

What happened to Kodak will happen in a lot of industries in the next 10 years - and most people don't see it coming.

Did you think in 1998 that 3 years later you would never take pictures on paper film again? Yet digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first ones only had 10,000 pixels, but followed Moore's law. So as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a long time, before it became way superior and got mainstream in only a few short years.

It will now happen with Artificial Intelligence, health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs.

Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Welcome to the Exponential Age.

Software will disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.

Uber is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now the biggest taxi company in the world.

Airbnb is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.

Artificial Intelligence : Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected.

In the US, young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of IBM Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for more or less basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. So if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, only specialists will remain.

Watson already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, 4 times more accurate than human nurses.

Facebook now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans.

By 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans.Autonomous Cars:

In 2018 the first self-driving cars will appear for the public. Around 2020, the complete industry will start to be disrupted. You don't want to own a car anymore. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination. You will not need to park it, you only pay for the driven distance and can be productive while driving.

Our kids will never get a driver's license and will never own a car. It will change the cities, because we will need 90-95% fewer cars for that. We can transform former parking space into parks. 1.2 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide.

We now have one accident every 100,000 km, with autonomous driving that will^ drop to one accident in 10 million km. That will save a million lives each year.

Most car companies may become bankrupt. Traditional car companies try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels. I spoke to a lot of engineers from Volkswagen and Audi; they are completely terrified of Tesla. 

Insurance Companies will have massive trouble because without accidents, the insurance will become 100x cheaper. Their car insurance business model will disappear.

Real estate will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will move further away to live in a more beautiful neighborhood. Electric cars won’t become mainstream until 2020. Cities will be less noisy because all cars will run on electric.

Electricity will become incredibly cheap and clean: Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can only now see the impact. Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. The price for solar will drop so much that all coal companies will be out of business by 2025.With cheap electricity comes cheap and abundant water.

Desalination now only needs 2kWh per cubic meter. We don't have scarce water in most places, we only have scarce drinking water. Imagine what will be possible if anyone can have as much clean water as he wants, for nearly no cost.

Health: There will be companies that will build a medical device (called the "Tricorder" from Star Trek) that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breathe into it. It then analyses 54 biomarkers that will identify nearly any disease. It will be cheap, so in a few years everyone on this planet will have access to world class medicine, nearly for free.

3D printing: The price of the cheapest 3D printer came down from $18,000 to $400 within 10 years. In the same time, it became 100 times faster.

All major shoe companies started 3D printing shoes.

Spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports.

The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for the large number of spare parts they used to have in the past.

At the end of this year, new smart phones will have 3D scanning possibilities. You can then 3D scan your feet and print your perfect shoe at home.

In China, they already 3D printed a complete 6-storey office building. By 2027, 10% of everything that's being^ produced will be 3D printed. 

Business Opportunities: If you think of a niche^ you want to go in, ask yourself: "in the future, do you think we will have that?" and if the answer is yes, how can you make that happen sooner? If it doesn't work with your phone, forget the idea.

And any idea designed for success in the 20th century is doomed in to failure in the 21st century.

Work: 70-80% of jobs will disappear in the next 20 years. There will be a lot of new jobs, but it is not clear if there will be enough new jobs in such a small time.

Agriculture: There will be a $100 agricultural robot in the future. Farmers in 3rd world countries can then become managers of their field instead of working all days on their fields. Agroponics will need much less water.

The first Petri dish produced veal is now available and will be cheaper than cow-produced veal in 2018. Right now, 30% of all agricultural surfaces is used for cows. Imagine if we don't need that space anymore.

There are several startups that will bring insect protein to the market shortly. It contains more protein than meat. It will be labeled as "alternative protein source" 
(because most people still reject the idea of eating insects).

There is an app call "moodies" which can already tell in which mood you are.

Until 2020 there will be apps that can tell by your facial expressions if you are lying. Imagine a political debate where it's being displayed when they are telling the truth and when not.

Bitcoin will become mainstream this year and might even become the default reserve currency. 

Longevity: Right now, the average life span increases by 3 months per year. Four years ago, the life span used to be 79 years, now it's^ 80 years. The increase itself is increasing and by 2030, there will be more than one year increase per year. So we all might live for a long long time, probably way more than 100. By that time the elites will have a secondary Brain embedded close to both sides of their fronto-temporal scalp it stores information about their experiences books they read what they heard etc through a High Def Camera just below their eyelids. For those who can afford it forgetfulness will be a forgotten phenomenon.
Advanced stem cell technology will allow you to " make " your own organs or replace defective ones early. Life expectancy will be around 115 to 125 yrs in most of developed world and around 100 years in the rest of the world.

Education: The cheapest smart phones are already at $10 in Africa and Asia. Until 2020, 70% of all humans will own a smart phone. That means, everyone has the same access to world class education.
Are you ready for the future.

Are you ready ?

09/01/2018, 3:08 pm - Chika Nels: SAFETY TIPS FROM N.O.A. PLEASE READ IT 

1. Never go to bed with your car's fuel tank empty (No fuel). In case of an emergency, what if your good neighbour isn't at home.

2. Never employ a nanny you don't know her home. Some of them are child traffickers in disguise.

3. Never go to bed with your phone empty (No airtime). Most emergencies happen at night.

4.  Do not stand or park your car under high tension cable especially when it is windy.

5.  Do not attempt to start your generator with your phone torchlight as the source of light. As this could cause explosion. 

6.  Do not answer telephone calls in the kitchen when your gas cylinder is turn on.

7.  Endeavour to crawl under the smoke if a house is engulfed by smoke, as walking straight could cause suffocation. Smoke mounts up. 
 
8.  If by mistake you swallow a fish bone, lick salt, and pull your ears while you cough out the fish bone. 

9.  If you are in any traffic or 'hold up', 'go- slow' as in local parlance, if you must remain in your car while it is not in motion, always apply your central lock. 

10.  Do not leave your children alone in the car with your dog or any pet. 

11.  Nowadays, never enter a lift alone if you must. So many are already gone through this.

12. Never leave your opened drink to take a call outside. It could be a plan to distract you. Many have been poisoned through this.

13. Never rush out to turn off the tap on hearing its sound in the night. It's a new robbery trick to wilfully bring you out. Remember, you didn't leave it running before retiring to bed.

09/01/2018, 10:04 pm - Tolulope Shokefun: Here's something the tech ladies here can benefit from

TechWomen is a global professional exchange that brings together women working in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to promote collaboration in science and technology.  Approximately 100 professional women working in STEM fields in 20 countries around the world will travel to the US in September 2018 for an intensive exchange. The 5-week program begins with a Tech Bootcamp Week in Silicon Valley, followed by individual 15-day fellowships at leading innovation companies and organizations in the San Francisco Bay area, and finally a 3-day wrap-up in Washington, DC.  Each participant will also complete a mentorship, working with impact coaches to formulate and pitch an idea to address a challenge in their home community. The winners of the pitch competition will receive seed funding to make their vision a reality.   

 

Interested applicants should apply directly at TechWomen.org. They will need to select one of six tracks: information technology, green technology, science, internet, biotechnology, or telecommunications.  Please note that the deadline is next Wednesday, January 17.

@ObyEzeks says red card to APC and PDP, now social media influencers, most of who largely wanna make just the money and hardly any good for general public but self have come at her. One thing is obvious. The politicians are already buying them and that space. Instead of the young millennials to rule this SM, from enjoying savagery in the hands of influencers to losing sense, they're not rallying around the right cause. 2019dey fear me aswear.

However, it is no news that politicians have already started making moves and buying influencers. 
The money is very reasonable for an average shirt sighted Nigerian person so I don't really blame them that's why I pray that I won't be tempted to join the spree when the offer comes which may be soon. For now,  I'm with any Youth politician that comes forth and I encourage us to support likewise.

11/01/2018, 6:37 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: Trends of Friendships and Relationships by Elisha Seyitan

I have noticed some new types of friendships/relationships among young people.
They include:
On and off closeness
Sweet and Nice on Social media (Facebook, Whatapp, Instagram) but awkward in physical interaction
Hi and Hi before then suddenly 'my friendship' (in jenifa's voice)
Best of friends then suddenly hi hi

The first two I have noticed between a guy and girl while the last more among the girls. 
 
For me it is beginning to seem like the political/socioeconomic inconsistencies in our society is reflecting in the forms of relationships developed lately. These trends have led to conversational awkwardness, social misfits, low self esteem .. 

I guess it is a millennial problem.
11/01/2018, 6:41 pm - Babajide Martins: Well said...
But then it's not just environment.

Phones and social medias add to this awkwardness...

My aunt said gone are the days when you would write letters to your friends. Going through the stress of writing and buying stamps means the friends mean a lot to you.

Relationships were far better then. 
Now.... nothing cost me to say hi to one person that I just want to greet and go 🤷🏿‍♂
11/01/2018, 6:42 pm - Babajide Martins: All I'm saying is we are awesome 😌

11/01/2018, 6:53 pm - Akolab: But have you noticed you have 3 to 5 people you are always in contact with either online or offline, for me I think it's interests and habits mostly that determines how long a conversation will be.
Error... I was once on a date with someone that have been chatting with for a few months, at first it was awkward but after the first 5 minutes we finally found a common topic both of us like, in this case our love of *Japanese Anime* 😅. You should have seen the look on people's face when we started arguing about who was the most  powerful shinobi🌚...... 

So it all boils down to interests and likes
11/01/2018, 6:54 pm - Akolab: Where is sports 🤷🏾‍♂?? Àbí you won't give us chance to Yab Arsenal fans 🌚 or morata
11/01/2018, 6:55 pm - Chika Nels: Lol😂. Okay, what day do we assign to that.  You no I'm not really a football person.

I wonder what have become of the present day relationships
We no longer wait for those carefully beautifully written letters of our loved ones
They have been replaced with instant messaging
Those letters reflected true emotions
You do not need to speak in person as what is written resonates over and over again 
Our emotions have now been replaced with emojis
I am sure when an emoji of a black man crying is done it will have some racial connotations
Our parents could wait for those letters 
As they reflected how long those relationships
Will last
You must surely mean a lot for anyone to put pen to paper back then
Now we are happy to get an instant reply 
No wonder relationships do not last long
As u cannot compare drafted words 
Written on a shit of paper 
That takes four days to get to the receiver 
I am sure when she receives such letter 
She doesn't need to be told to be kissed through the phone
She must definitely will kiss the letter 
She will hug it jealously and put a frame on it..

12/01/2018, 12:23 am - Akanni Hafeez: Laaaal. 

Face the reality ma'am...
Face it. 

Buhari's first ish and struggle was with saraki and his mob and then later it became clear that integrity doesn't necessarily fight kwarupshun. 

I didn't say more than half of what you think I said here my dear. I haven't said cos he hasn't been tested he can't run. 

The person capable? Last time, it was Buhari, the one eyed man in d land of the blind. They only thing I welcome here is the disruption that'd shift focus off the APC n PDP... That's welcome. 

Politics my dear works with track record. Let Fela win, he'd face the real deal. The real deal!
12/01/2018, 12:24 am - Akanni Hafeez: So you'd hear powers that be. I haven't said I won't vote or would vote in d wrong person as you may fear. But who really knows the right person sef?
12/01/2018, 7:12 am - ‪+234 808 158 8398‬: I could care less about APC or PDP. I dont give a hoot. Personally, i think the APC-PDP mentality just shows how insane the general populace of this country is, pardon my vulgarity. We place expectations on this 2 political groups expecting the same result. As it is, corruption has eaten root-deep into almost all Nigerians, not only politicians. And for the 'powers that be', we are truly the ones who gave them power. When we fail to exercise our own right and power as a people, and we dont get actively involved, we give the unworthy this power. And that is what we now face as consequence. Factly, all i'm saying is lets know the candidates and simply vote for who you perceive to be the best leaving aside the acclaimed corruption and powers-that-be influences. Lets believe in them first and support them as best as we can.

12/01/2018, 7:42 am - Chika Nels: *_Quick interesting tips with e-Learn Hub_*
1. Never use your favorite song as your alarm clock, you'll end up hating it.

2. If you put your fingers in ice water immediately after painting your nails the paint will dry instantly.

3. If you're going for a run, the jog.fm app will select a music playlist for you based on your pace.

4. You're 50% more likely to remember something if you speak it out loud instead of simply reading it over and over.

5. Clothes shrink too small? Soak them in a mixture of hot water and hair conditioner for 5 minutes, to unshrink them.
12/01/2018, 7:43 am - Chika Nels: 😆
12/01/2018, 7:53 am - Chika Nels: On the e-Learn Time table today, we have *MUSIC & ART,   VOCATIONAL SKILLS*

12/01/2018, 8:00 am - Tolulope Shokefun: Fun fact:
If the hair on the human head is left to grow without cutting it at all, it can grow up to a length of 5 feet. That's about the height of an average human being.

12/01/2018, 10:00 am - Babajide Martins: Yea...but from experience, we know that ain't shit..

The presidents and senators and governors we have been recycling since time immemorial have done nothing but throw this country into peril
12/01/2018, 10:00 am - Babajide Martins: Well sha...that's not today's topic
12/01/2018, 10:01 am - Babajide Martins: *DIGITAL PAINTING*
12/01/2018, 10:02 am - Babajide Martins: According to Wikipedia,

_Digital painting is a method of creating an art object in a computer. It adapts traditional painting medium such as acrylic paint, oils, ink, watercolor, etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as canvas, paper, polyester etc. by means of computer software driving printers._
12/01/2018, 10:03 am - Babajide Martins: Ah who's typing 🙄
12/01/2018, 10:04 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Then why do some people struggle with growing their hair... I doubt this though... Your hair grow more when you cut, trimming kinda... You trim, remove dead ends and new ones come up.
Some people will trim and still not see a result, like a gene stuff
12/01/2018, 10:05 am - Chika Nels: He lost 1.2B in a business deal and has had a Mental disorder the past 6 years😭

12/01/2018, 10:07 am - Babajide Martins: So most people believe digital arts and prints cannot be like the original painting with its textures and all...true..
But there's a seeming uniqueness in it. 
Most times, images are more accurately represented in digital artworks
12/01/2018, 10:07 am - Babajide Martins: _Visual characteristics derive from the power of a computer to attach geometrical formulas to lines, shapes and forms. While it is impossible for a human hand to create exactly identical shapes, or to construct a perfect circle or a perfectly straight line, for a computer it is difficult to do anything else_
12/01/2018, 10:08 am - Akanni Hafeez: Seriously? What's the stuff, maybe I missed it.
12/01/2018, 10:08 am - ‪+234 810 126 3079‬: 📝
12/01/2018, 10:10 am - Babajide Martins: There are mainly four directions for digital painting:

*Computer generated painting:* _Characteristics of digital painting are present. The resolution is optimal (the highest printable) and size is flexible (the largest printable)_.
*Raster painting:* _Characteristics of digital painting are largely absent. Resolution and size are fixed._
*Vector painting* _Characteristics of digital painting are present. The resolution is optimal (the highest printable) and the size is flexible (the largest printable)._
*Vector-raster painting:* _Characteristics of digital painting are present. Resolution and size are fixed_
12/01/2018, 10:10 am - Tosin Lawal: But you know he won't win shay
12/01/2018, 10:11 am - Babajide Martins: Hey hey.. .
I have a lecture here...🌚🙄
12/01/2018, 10:12 am - Babajide Martins: Computer generated' 

_refers to an indirect procedure that goes back to the early days of artificial intelligence and programming. The artist doesn't create the artwork by hand but instructs the computer how to do it_
12/01/2018, 10:13 am - Chijioke: Well said
12/01/2018, 10:13 am - Chijioke: But I disagree that we put them into office
12/01/2018, 10:13 am - Babajide Martins: It's just like those apps on our phone we use to edit images...
Or those filters on Photoshop used to change the way the photos look .... probably into an artwork...
12/01/2018, 10:14 am - Chijioke: THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WITH A FAIR ELECTORAL PROCESS, IT'S ALL RIGGED! "THE LOVE OF POWER"

12/01/2018, 10:16 am - Babajide Martins: 👍🏿
12/01/2018, 10:19 am - Akanni Hafeez: Yes! Too important guy! Too important. I don't even have strength to argue. Blind optimism is the one that doesn't put into consideration the reality of things. Be optimistic yes, but with sense. History always has sth for us to learn. Track record matters. Even for ministerial appointments, the bulk of things considered r things you have as relevant to where you wanna go. Can you employ men into your firm based on passion only? How about a track record of where they're coming from as related and indicating of where they're going? 

Don't fooled, even macron in France has been involved somehow all through. Before u shout young people, where have they being learning things? Presidency is too big for wishful n hopeful voting. Think well.
12/01/2018, 10:20 am - Babajide Martins: 🚮
12/01/2018, 10:21 am - Babajide Martins: So a computer generated artwork is basically not a painting
It's you telling the software what to do with the pic and at the end getting results...

The artist has no control per say..

12/01/2018, 7:35 pm - Babajide Martins: *DIGITAL PAINTING*
12/01/2018, 7:35 pm - Babajide Martins: There are mainly four directions for digital painting:

*Computer generated painting:* _Characteristics of digital painting are present. The resolution is optimal (the highest printable) and size is flexible (the largest printable)_.
*Raster painting:* _Characteristics of digital painting are largely absent. Resolution and size are fixed._
*Vector painting* _Characteristics of digital painting are present. The resolution is optimal (the highest printable) and the size is flexible (the largest printable)._
*Vector-raster painting:* _Characteristics of digital painting are present. Resolution and size are fixed_
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Babajide Martins: _Visual characteristics derive from the power of a computer to attach geometrical formulas to lines, shapes and forms. While it is impossible for a human hand to create exactly identical shapes, or to construct a perfect circle or a perfectly straight line, for a computer it is difficult to do anything else_
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Babajide Martins: According to Wikipedia,

_Digital painting is a method of creating an art object in a computer. It adapts traditional painting medium such as acrylic paint, oils, ink, watercolor, etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as canvas, paper, polyester etc. by means of computer software driving printers._
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Babajide Martins: So most people believe digital arts and prints cannot be like the original painting with its textures and all...true..
But there's a seeming uniqueness in it. 
Most times, images are more accurately represented in digital artworks
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Tosin Lawal: It's not whynin 
It's actually a good check
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Babajide Martins: Computer generated' 

_refers to an indirect procedure that goes back to the early days of artificial intelligence and programming. The artist doesn't create the artwork by hand but instructs the computer how to do it_
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Babajide Martins: It's just like those apps on our phone we use to edit images...
Or those filters on Photoshop used to change the way the photos look .... probably into an artwork...
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Babajide Martins: So a computer generated artwork is basically not a painting
It's you telling the software what to do with the pic and at the end getting results...

The artist has no control per say..
12/01/2018, 7:36 pm - Babajide Martins: <Media omitted>
12/01/2018, 7:37 pm - Tosin Lawal: Is image processing going to come up at any point Jide
12/01/2018, 7:43 pm - Babajide Martins: No 🙄
Tf...art not control
12/01/2018, 7:44 pm - Babajide Martins: *Raster painting*

_Both in procedure and in appearance, a raster, grid, or bitmap painting most closely resembles a traditional painting with real brushes and paint. The image is created on the screen with a virtual brush in a spontaneous, stroke by stroke manner. Colors and lines are registered pixel by pixel. They are not summarized and translated into formula's. As a result, forms and lines preserve all the characteristics of the individual painter's hand. _
12/01/2018, 7:45 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Lol😰🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
12/01/2018, 7:46 pm - Babajide Martins: <Media omitted>
12/01/2018, 7:46 pm - Babajide Martins: <Media omitted>
12/01/2018, 7:46 pm - Babajide Martins: <Media omitted>
12/01/2018, 7:46 pm - Babajide Martins: The major disadvantage of Raster painting is that it's fixed in size..and may pixelate or lose quality in larger prints
12/01/2018, 7:48 pm - Babajide Martins: *Vector painting*

_A vector painting is based on vector graphics. It is made by choosing basic shapes like circles, triangles and squares, or by painting them freehand, and manipulating and transforming them with special tools. The somewhat elaborate process is less suitable for intuitive, spontaneous work than raster painting. All lines and shapes are captured into geometrical formulas, with no room left for characteristics of the individual painter's hand. _
12/01/2018, 7:49 pm - Tosin Lawal: Just because Fash taught doesn't mean it was control

12/01/2018, 7:52 pm - Babajide Martins: *Vector-raster painting, smoothing*

_Vector-raster painting combines the individual characteristics of raster with formula-based lines and forms of vector. Full control and a visual contrast between vector and raster forms is obtained by working on separate layers or in separate programs for vector and raster, respectively. The raster elements loose sharpness when enlarged, which necessitates manual correction._

13/01/2018, 8:56 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: <Media omitted>
13/01/2018, 8:57 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Also, wash the Rice and set aside.Place a wok or deep pan on low to medium heat, add the coconut oil, when it heats up, add the minced Garlic and Ginger, saute for 2 minutes, be careful not to burn the Garlic…       
Then add the Chicken, fry till its fully cooked, then scoop out the Chicken and set aside…
13/01/2018, 8:58 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Place a Saucepan on high heat, add the oil used for frying the chicken along with the Garlic and Ginger, add the coconut milk and bring to a rolling boil…

Now, add the stock and continue to boil. if you haven’t got stock, simply add water and double the seasoning. Then, add the Scotch Bonnet, Onions, Curry, Thyme, Chicken Seasoning, Knorr Chicken cubes, Black Pepper and Salt to taste, stir and combine…

13/01/2018, 9:00 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: For the guys who didn't understand what stock means.  It's the brownish, and a little bit thick water gotten from boiling your meats.
13/01/2018, 9:01 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Now add the washed Rice and combine. Make sure the liquid is enough to cook the rice through..

Cover the rice with foil paper then close tightly with a lid and leave to cook. Remember to check the rice every now and then to prevent burning, add more liquid and seasoning if required….

When the rice is cooked, add the cooked Chicken, Shrimp, spring Onions Kidney/Liver and combine..

Then add the desiccated Coconut, combine. Switch the heat off and leave to steam with the residual heat for 2 minutes…
Realised some of my Shrimps still had their veins in. Too late to sort out at this point…?

It’s ready…

13/01/2018, 9:14 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: You can use any pepper of your choice. But I feel black pepper either  *fresh yellow ones* or *black powdered ones* give it a particular aroma you can't get from other types of pepper.
13/01/2018, 9:14 pm - Akanbi Jadesola: OK, thanks
13/01/2018, 9:14 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: You're welcome 🙂

13/01/2018, 9:16 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: If you will be using red pepper ( scotch bonnet) also known as Ata rodo, it would be better if it's smoothly grinded. To have a better outlook. The beauty of the food also matters. You can use Ata rodo and black pepper together. If you checked the ingredients properly
13/01/2018, 9:17 pm - ‪+234 909 008 1261‬: Noted

13/01/2018, 9:47 pm - Chika Nels: @2348103352499 In case you are wondering,  a lecture is currently going on about cooking certain dishes. 
Don't worry, I'll brief you more as time goes on.
13/01/2018, 9:47 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Ingredients
600g Assorted Meats
Onion
2-4 Scotch Bonnet thinly chopped
2 Tablespoons Pepper Soup Spice
3 Cloves Garlic
1/2 Inch Ginger Root
1 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper (Ata gun gun)
3 Tablespoons Dry or fresh Efinrin/ Basil/ leaves OR Utazi Leaves
1 Tablespoon Black Pepper
3 Knorr cubes
Salt to taste
13/01/2018, 9:47 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Preparation:
Wash your meats thoroughly, then transfer into a pot. Remember to boil Offals like Kidney, Liver, Heart separately. Do not add any water. Add blended/Chopped Garlic, Onions and Ginger. Also add the Knorr cubes and salt to taste.
13/01/2018, 9:48 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: <Media omitted>
13/01/2018, 9:48 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Place on medium heat and allow the meats sweat out their moisture and absorb the spices and onions. This should take 13-15 minutes…

Then add enough water to cook the meats and leave to cook till soft.
You’ll need to have at least 5 cups of meat stock by the time the meats are cooked.
13/01/2018, 9:49 pm - Chika Nels: Hmmnn...
13/01/2018, 9:49 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: When the meats are soft, add the Chopped or blended Scotch Bonnet and Cayenne pepper…
If you used coarsely blended instead of properly blended or Chopped Onions, it’s advisable to sieve your stick using a mesh sieve as you’ll end up with particles in your Pepper soup. I don’t mind mine having particles so I didn’t bother.

Then add the Black Pepper, combine and cook for 2 minutes..

Add then the Pepper soup Spice. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. You may need to add some more water if your pepper soup tastes too concentrated….

Your Assorted Meat Pepper Soup is ready….

14/01/2018, 8:57 am - Chika Nels: *e-Learn Hub fun hacks*
1. Rubbing an eraser on a scratched LCD screen can sometimes remove the scratch.

2. To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, double the Celsius number and add 28.

3. Put your wet sponge in the microwave for 2 minutes to kill 99% of the bacteria.

4. To clean a microwave: Put a bowl of water inside and microwave for 3 minutes. The steam will moisten everything up making cleaning simple!

5. Do not use chemicals to kill ants. Instead, get a spray bottle, fill it with water and salt (25%), shake well, spray... boom, dead!

Good morning Hub🤗

Missus Rajayi: A secret that has been uncovered! Cancer is not a disease but business!!

Professor Nandita deSouza from Cambridge University:
The word called cancer is a lie...

You might not believe this but cancer is not a disease; it is a business.

Cancer has become widespread; it has affected the old, young, baby and everyone.

Sharing this wonderful post will expose many of the hidden hands of the world's manipulators and annoy them.

Do you know that the book "World Without Cancer" has up till now been prevented from being translated into many world languages?

Know this: there is no disease called cancer. Cancer consists of only a deficiency of vitamin B17. It is  nothing else.

Avoid chemotherapy, surgery and or taking medicines with strong side effects.

You would recall that in the past, quite a large number of seamen lost their life to a named disease (scurvy); a disease that took the life of numerous people as well. And a number of people got an enormous income from it. Afterwards, it was discovered that scurvy was just a deficiency of vitamin C. That means it wasn't a disease (illness).

Cancer is also just like that! The colonizing world and the enemies of humanity established the cancer industry and made it into a business. from which they earn billions in income.

The cancer industry flourished after world war II. To fight cancer, all these delays, details and enormous expenditures are not needed. They only go to line the pockets of colonizers, especially since the cure for the condition was found long ago.

The prevention and cure of cancer will be obtained simply through the following strategies:

Those who have cancer should first try to know what cancer is. Do not panic! You should investigate the condition.

Nowadays does anyone die of an illness called scurvy? No. Because it gets cured.

Since cancer is only a deficiency of vitamin B17, eating 15 to 20 pieces of apricot stone/nucleus (fruit stone) everyday is enough.

Eat wheat bud (wheat sprouts). Wheat bud is a miraculous anti-cancer medicine. It is a rich source of liquid oxygen and the strongest anti-cancer matter named laetrile. This matter is present in the fruit stone of apple and is the extracted form of vitamin B17 (Amygdalin).

The American medicinal industry has started implementing the law forbidding laetrile production. This medicine is being manufactured in Mexico and gets smuggled into USA.

Dr. Harold W. Manner, in a book named "Death of Cancer" has stated that the success of cancer treatment with laetrile is as high as above 90%.

*Sources of  Amygdalin* (Vitamin B17)

The foods containing vitamin B17 include the following: 

-The fruit stone or grain(seed) of fruits. This contains the highest amount of vitamin B17 in nature. This includes fruit stone of apple, apricot, peach, pear, and prune (dried plum).

-Common beans, corns(grains), which include bean, lentil sprout (lentil bud) Lima (Lima beans) and pea.

-Kernels: Bitter Almond (Richest source of vitamin B-17 in nature) and Indian almond.

-Mulberries: almost all mulberries such as black mulberry, blueberry, raspberry and strawberry.

-Seeds (Grains): sesame and linseed (seed of linen/flax seed).

-Groats of oats, barley, brown rice, groats of block wheat, linseed, millet and rye.

This vitamin is found in grains and fruit stones of apricot, brewer's yeast, rough rice (paddy) and sweetmeat pumpkin.

*List of Anti-Cancer Foods*
•Apricots (kernels/seeds)
•seeds from other fruits like apples, cherries, peaches, prunes, plums, pears
•Lima beans
•Fava beans
•Wheatgrass
•Almonds
•Raspberries
•Elderberries
•Strawberries
•Blackberries
•Blueberries
•Buckwheat
•Sorghum
•Barley
•Millet
•Cashews
•Macadamia nuts
•Bean sprouts
 All are the highest sources of absorbable vitamin B17.

Missus Rajayi: Ingesting dishwashing liquids (used in the kitchen) and hand washing liquid (used in the restroom) is the main cancer causing factor so your eating of them should be restricted.

You will surely say that we do not eat them!
However, you daily wash your hands with hand washing liquid and wash your plates with dishwashing liquid.

The liquid is absorbed and will not leave the plate with washing. When cooking or eating  food, the soap in the plate or dish gets attached to the hot food and so we end up eating the dishwashing liquid with our food. Even if you rinse the plate hundreds of times, that will be of no use.

But the solution is to pour half of the dishwashing liquid and hand washing liquid and top it up with vinegar.
It is as simple as that.

Do not eat blood cancer causing agents and also save your family from this danger. 

Similarly, seriously desist from washing vegetables with even a few drops of dishwashing liquid because irrespective of how much you would rinse them, the chemicals would have already entered the tissues of the vegetable and will not get rinsed away.

Instead, soak fruits and vegetables with salt and then rinse with water. And to keep them fresh.

1. Sleep less. This is one of the best investments you can make to make your life more productive and rewarding. Most people do not need more than 6 hours to maintain an excellent state of health. Try getting up one hour earlier for 21 days and it will develop into a powerful habit. Remember, it is the quality not the quantity of sleep that is important. And just imagine having an extra 30 hours a month to spend on the things that are important to you.

15/01/2018, 2:41 pm - Mosad: *DON’T WRITE YOUR SURNAME BEFORE YOUR FIRST NAME* 

People must understand that the arrangement of names is standard across the globe. When you’re asked to mention or write your name, call/write your first name first before any other names and the name that comes last is presumed to be your last name/surname. For example, if you’re James and your surname is John, in writing your name, write James John not the other way round.

All over the globe, the standard practice is:
First name 
Middle name(s) if any 
Surname or Last Name

However, if you write your surname first, always put comma so that readers can identify it as such. For example, if you write *John, James* a reader will know that John is your surname and James is your first name. 

Another acceptable practice is — you write your surname in caps and keep the first name in lower keys. For instance, *JOHN James* will communicate to every reader that your surname is John and your first name is James. 

Also, if you want to introduce yourself with your titles, mention the first name first in the sequence. For example; I am
*Prof/Dr./Rev./Mr. James John*
It tells a reader that James is your first name while John is your last. In instances where you mention your surname first after your title, don’t add your first name. For example, “Hello, I am Mr. John” don’t add your first name James. 

People are losing juicy jobs due to these minor mistakes they make at job interviews. Stop mentioning your surname before your first name. Surnames always come last that’s why in some jurisdictions, they specifically call it your *Last Name*.

1. Running low on battery? Put your phone on Airplane mode and it'll charge much faster!

2. Storing batteries in the freezer can up to double their life span.

3.You can use Google as a timer by typing "Set timer (x) minutes" into the search bar.

4. Locket is an Android app that displays ads on your lock screen, this means you get paid every time you unlock your phone.

5. Using your phone while it's charging can damage the battery. This is why the cords for chargers are so short.
 
6. Can't afford Microsoft Word? Get "open office", it's the same thing except it's free and has more features.

16/01/2018, 7:46 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: *WHO IS YOUR ICE?*

The Federal Road Safety Commission has just come out with the concept of “ICE"..  Please read carefully, it may save your life or that of someone you know" 

We all carry our mobile phones with names & numbers stored in its memory. If we were to be involved in an accident or were taken ill, the people attending to us would have our mobile phone but wouldn't know who to call. 

Yes, there are hundreds of numbers stored but which one is the contact person in case of an emergency? Hence this 'ICE' (In Case of Emergency) Campaign. 

The concept of 'ICE' is catching on quickly. It is a method of quick contact during emergency situations.

As mobile phones are carried by the majority of the population, all you need to do is store the number of a contact person or persons who should be contacted during emergency under the name 'ICE' ( In Case Of Emergency). 

The idea was thought up by a paramedic who found that when he went to the scenes of accidents there were always mobile phones with patients but they didn't know which number to call. He therefore thought that it would be a good idea if there was a nationally recognised name for this purpose. In an emergency situation, Emergency Service personnel and hospital staff would be able to quickly contact the right person by simply dialling the number you have stored as 'ICE'. 

Please forward this. It won't take too many 'forwards' before everybody will know about this. It really could save your life, or put a loved one's mind at rest. For more than one contact names, simply enter ICE1, ICE2 and  ICE3 etc. 

*PASS THIS AROUND AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AND THIS CAN HELP IN AN EMERGENCY".*

It's worth sharing please Forward as received.

NEWS ALERT TO ALL CHRISTIANS
AS I SPEAK NOW, the DSS is holding siege the premises of Prophet ISA El buba. You remember him? The Prophet who recently sent warning to this government About the evils of this administration. 
Christians have been called out to resist this impunity... We have information that the church Premises at No 1 Kachim Ibrahim way Jos is under a very serious siege. 
The suspicion is that he is being targeted for his vocal criticism to this government and summons for Christians to obtain their PVCs in preparation for the next general election. 
It is clear that Christians are now being targeted for the flimsiest of reasons. This must be resisted at all cost.
16/01/2018, 10:04 am - Akanni Hafeez: There was a video here that relates with this yeah? Just to confirm...

(Some politicians will unleash the money they have saved abroad and elsewhere for years. Mind you Savings are leakages to an economy). Election years are followed by decline in economy in this part f the world due to the interplay of capital flights which is caused by slow government policies, transitions of power, instabilities, pressure on FX due to withdrawals and other exchange transactions that are not capital in nature

16/01/2018, 3:51 pm - Akanni Hafeez: Lol.
16/01/2018, 4:02 pm - Akanni Hafeez: FACT 1

 *1. Waiting to be done with NYSC before you begin to seriously apply for a job is one of the greatest mistakes you ever want to make.* 

 This is one mistake many of us make or are about to make. You may nearly slap yourself if you wait till then. In fact before you finish NYSC you should have applied for at least 20 jobs and attended at least 2 interviews, that’s the mindset of a serious job seeker. Except you have a job waiting for you somewhere.
FACT 2

 *2. If you made a 2:2 or third class, you are in a more competitive market and so you may need a super strategy to standout.*


 This is because the job market is saturated and so one way many employers try to streamline the number of applicants is by stating that they need 2:1 or first class only.
This should not be a source of worry but should be a reason why you have to up your game. You need to go for additional training that are relevant (mark the word relevant), add some more skill, make your CV on point and all your applications superb! You can’t have a 2:2 and you are applying with different first class and 2:1 and you won’t do something different. You just have to stand out to improve your chances. Also you should apply in more places to increase your chances. 

 I will tell us two real life stories. Are we following?
 Have you heard of this man called Tony Elumelu? I heard a story about him. Tony Elumelu graduated with a 2:2. His first banking job. The requirement was a first class or 2:2. But he still applied. Tony Elumelu applied but added a cover note, explaining why he felt he was still qualified despite graduating with a 2:2. Guess what? He was hired!
I tell you the story of a friend of mine. The person is with a top multinational company right now. She made a 2:2, but contacted me before applying for the job. I gave her some advice, helped her with a "wow" CV and prepared her for the interview. The day she went for the interview, all the interviewers kept commending her CV that they forgot to look at her grade. She was moved to the next stage of the interview. By this time, they had dropped some candidates. She was called again for a second interview, this time around with the top managers. She was scared. Again, they started praising her CV. Asking her questions and commending her. At the tail end, that was when one of them saw the grade. They were like, you mean you finished with a 2:2? She said yes. Then she explained why. Because she was honest and had already won their hearts, guess what! Weeks later, she was called to resume work!
 This again is a fact many graduates and job seekers don't know!
FACT 3

 *3. You don’t always need to know anyone to enter a company*

 I don't know where most young people got this mindset from. They just conclude that all jobs can only be gotten by connection. I want to ask you a question. If you owned a company and you want that company to really grow. As in, you really want it to move forward. Say the truth would you like to hire all your employee based on connection? Wouldn't you want to use common sense to ensure that you have 1..2..3..4 who are really really qualified? Because if all workers were by connection it means the company will crumble. It means they are not looking for skill. And you know what that means.. the company will fall!!!

 So because they know this, they can't keep giving all the jobs by connection. There is a place for skill, for those who are truly qualified. So the big question is..Are you among the few qualified?
FACT 4

 *4. Getting into a company or organization is one thing, how you get in is another thing.*

 This point is very crucial, please follow carefully!

 The route via which you enter a company goes a long way to determine your salary, your future prospects in that company, your promotion or even the benefits you will be entitled to.

 Its one thing to be working in shell or Mobil or Total, but the big question is how did you enter? You entered as what?

 Have you heard of any of the following terms: Graduate Management Trainee, Technical Trainee, Contract Staff, Intern, Outsourcing?

 Let me explain further taking the routes I mentioned above one after the other.

 Do you know that the best way to enter a multinational company (MNC) as a young graduate is either as an intern or a graduate trainee. 

Let me explain. An *intern* is not yet employed. He/she will be paid, but is being trained to work. If they find you competent they can now fully recruit you to become a trainee. 

Now if you must enter a company and you want to enjoy the highest benefits, try your best to enter the Management Trainee programme. 

Those who eventually become MDs and Head of Departments are those who enter as *Graduate Trainees*. 

They are the ones the company likes to send abroad to do one course or the other. They are the ones with the fatter salary. They are the big boys and girls. This is why they are usually few!

 The truth is not every one can enter as a graduate trainee, but aspire to do so, there is no harm in aiming big!


 A *technical trainee* is usually for all the technical work. They usually like to take HND and OND for these roles. They believe they have the technical knowledge

 The only thing is that, they are not paid as much as the Graduate Management Trainee

 Then for *contract staff*, that one your salary is smaller. You are on contract and so your contract can end anytime, and you end up jobless again 
*Outsourcing* - The company hires another company to do something for them. so you are working with company A, Shell hired company A on contract. so shell will pay your Company, then your company will pay you. 
 so you see, i am in shell, i am in shell...The right question is how did you enter shell? And whats your role in shell?
FACT 5

*5. When applying for a job in which you were given an email address to forward your CV, there are seven points you need to note.*

 I. Your CV should be in pdf format- it should not be in word because it can scatter when opened on the other end. Except you were specifically told to send it that way.
II. You should ALWAYS attach a cover letter. Listen to me they may not say it but it’s a secret why they screen candidates out (it should be in pdf too)
III. You must have a subject and the subject should state the position you are applying for.
IV. Your email must not be empty! It’s a sin, many make that mistake. Your email should have a catchy and stimulating body which is similar but more straight forward and direct like the cover letter
V. Your application must have a complementary close (and optionally a picture which you insert through your email complementary close setting)
VI. You must do a proper search of that company and the role you are applying for.
VII. Try to use a computer not a phone. The greatest error you want to make is having the employer see things like “sent from my blackberry Z10” or “sent from my tecnoc8”. That shows how lazy you are and how you can’t make the extra effort of applying with professionalism

 I have seen a lot of graduates err in this regard. They keep saying they have applied everywhere but they never get called. It is because your application was shabby and not pleasant to your employer.
Fact 6
*Cc vs Bcc*

-How many of us have seen this stuff in our emails?
     -who knows what they are used for?
 Okay, let me explain.

 Cc stands for "carbon copy." Anyone you add to the cc: field of a message receives a copy of that message when you send it. All other recipients of that message can see that person you designated as a cc: recipient. 

Bcc: stands for "blind carbon copy." Anyone you add to the bcc: field of a message receives a copy of that message when you send it. But, bcc: recipients are invisible to all the other recipients of the message including other bcc: recipients.

 Now what is the importance of this knowledge of Cc and Bcc?

 Sometimes if you are being referred by someone to apply for a job, you may sometimes need to put the person that referred you in copy to further strengthen your chances. Its more like a referral. 

If you want the person you send the application, to know who referred you, you use Cc, if you want to code it you use BBC.
FACT 7

 *7. Most of the available jobs are not usually advertised*
 No matter how thoroughly you search for job openings on online job portals,  job agencies,  newspapers ads or even on the company's website -  whatever jobs you find that way is only 15 percent of what's available. only 15 percent!!!

That's because 85 percent of jobs are never publicized. This is absolutely true,  and done for good reasons.

The employers try to avoid the painful and costly process of sorting through the thousands of mostly crappy applications that follow any publicized job opening,  so they would rather use other means of hiring the right people that don't require public advertisement.

 The fact that you don't see any job openings doesn't mean a company is not hiring. So you can connect directly and can convince the company that your are the right person. You will be hired whether or not any job was advertised.

 Again I must say... This doesn't mean jobs are not advertised at all.

 Now there are three key people whom, if your CV can just get to them, they have the power to get you employed. 

 1. Heads of the department, unit or team in which you wish to work
2. The HR Manager
3. The CEO, MD or founder of the company

How then can your CV get to them? There is what they can targeted emailing.
FACT 8

 *8. Doing a Masters immediately after NYSC is very dangerous for some categories of people!*

I know some people want to add something to their 2:2 or to their courses because they may not have studied some kind of courses that are very well appreciated in Nigeria
-But Masters immediately after NYSC is not for everybody.
i. If your family is broke and waiting for you to come and help them out
You would rather take that job, start looking for certifications, then you can sponsor yourself for masters.
ii. If you are like 24 and above, doing a masters immediately may not be advisable. By the time you are done they tell you not more than 26 years old (so you have no job experience, and you have lost on the age side)
-If you must do masters, do your calculations and consultations well. Don’t be a copy copy! Don’t follow crowd. Understand why you want to do it.
FACT 9

*9. Some of your CVs never get read by the employers*
Some companies use what is called an optimization software to scan through thousands of CVs looking for keywords. Any CV that doesn't have some keywords they are looking for get trashed. 
Only after they finish optimization does a human being now start looking at the CVs remaining one by one.
Finally... FACT 10

*10. Getting a job is a full time job!*

Allow this point to sink into your head! If you are unemployed right now, you need to employ yourself into a new job called - GETTING A JOB

 When something very important to you gets missing in your house, how do you search for it please?

 You check under the table, inside your room, the toilet, u call ur uncle, u turn everywhere upside down!

is that correct?
 So why is it that when its time to look for a job we do it with some lackadaisical attitude?

 My dear, Nigeria is hard! To get a job, you have to be violent about it. You have to attend seminars, ask questions, apply here and there..as in let it be serious!

 You don't get a job by watching Africa Magic

 You don't get a job by going to cinema house every weekend

 You don't get a job by knowing all the telemundo series. 

No way! Getting a job is serious business.

Sentiment apart,

Every recent graduate in the business of getting a job in this era needs:

1. A Good smart phone (no matter how cheap) 
2. A good monthly data plan (not all this 100 naira per month subscription) plus good Internet connection. 
3. Access to power supply for minimum 2 hours daily. 
4. Network with "correct" groups.
5. A laptop once in a while (could be your own, your neighbors own or you go to cyber Cafe).

Shell or Nestlé or whoever won't hear you were broke and so you  couldn't come online to see their post for a vacancy that suited you.

16/01/2018, 10:15 pm - ‪+234 909 192 0347‬: Prof. Wole Soyinka says :

'WHERE DID WE GO
WRONG?

WAKE UP NIGERIAN YOUTHS!'~~~

"Awolowo was 37 years,
Akintola 36,
Ahmadu Bello 36,
Balewa 34,
Okotie-Eboh 27
and Enahoro 27

And they led the struggle for Nigeria Independence after
the death of Macaulay. Only Zik was 42 at the time!

In 1966, the first military coup was led by K
Nzeogwu who was 29 years

and countered by

M.Mohammed 28,
T. Danjuma 28,
I. Babangida 25,
J. Garba 23,
Sani Abacha 23,
and M. Yar'adua 23,

And brought into power

Y. Gowon 32,
Ojukwu 33,
Obasanjo 29,
And Buhari 24!

Most of the military governors who governed the
states under the successive military regimes were
under 30 years.

Also, the brief democratic dispensation which interjected the military interregnums also saw some
Senators and members of the House of
Representatives, in particular, populated by persons
under 30!

Under 30's were also not in short supply with
appointments - we have examples of

MT Mbu who
became Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister at 23

and Pat Utomi who became a Federal Adviser at 27

And so on and so forth!

NOW: Why is it that almost all this age bracket is today still sleeping in 3-seater chairs in their
parents’ homes?

Why is it that this age bracket is today still
collecting pocket money from their parents?

Why is it that this age bracket is today still writing JAMB?

Why is it that this age bracket today still 'sagg' their trousers?

Why is it that this age bracket is today still
searching for jobs and not yet married?

Why is it that this age bracket is today no longer qualified to even be leaders of youth wings of political parties?

Why is it that this age bracket is today so docile?

Why is this age bracket today incapable of feeding itself?

Why is it that this age bracket is today barred from even aspiring to certain political offices?

Why is it that this age bracket is today incapacitated, unwilling, unable and incapable of
asking questions?

GOD BLESS NIGERIA!"

From Prof Wole Soyinka.

This is real Food for Thought!

There's a limit to what I can say here, but know I appreciate your friendship. I sincerely hold dear every memory from class to party to exams to Mac Nels ventures to lago on the ball at sport centre to your fellowship at guest house and all the yummy to Prof's house to the nick names to the great plans and dreams to the yr five spoiling you gave me to wishing I had you for s childhood friend to being the biggest fan of your first song. You'll never lose the wonder, you'll never walk alone. You have more ideas, more impact and more understanding of God's love for you in Christ Jesus. You and yours are kept from all evil. Till we seventy, we keep balling, in the 80s, we'd keep dreaming still. You have a beautiful life now and always bruh. More love, more life, more God!

Last year we did a similar thing on my coral group's whatsapp page. It was initially fun until after a few months. I think birthdays are cool. If you are busy, you'll know you owe the hub 1hr 15mins on the hotseat. You can arrange to postpone to a more convenient time that'll be within the 30 hours after the main day. 
Good morning Hub

17/01/2018, 10:22 am - ‪+234 812 093 8116‬: Not Vulgarity But Knowledge??

In Ancient England, People Could Not Have Sex Without King's Permission.

To Have A Baby, They Were Supposed To Get King's Consent.

They Were Then Given A Card To Hang On Their Door While Having Sex,

Which Read As: "Fornication Under The Consent of King" (F.U.C.K.)

So The Word 'Fuck' Came In to Existence..!

Anybody knew about this ...? No ...😀

Spread This Fucking Knowledge!

 *Note* The vagina is naturally  inhabited with healthy bacteria, but if something disrupts their healthy functioning, Then unhealthy bacteria like BV takes over

17/01/2018, 1:34 pm - Dinah: The Major Factor is BV(Bacteria Vaginosis) This is just an imbalance of the bacteria that are normally present in the vagina
17/01/2018, 1:35 pm - Dinah: Other factors includes:
Excessive sweating
Control pills
17/01/2018, 1:35 pm - Dinah: Usage of expired Lubricants

17/01/2018, 1:40 pm - ‪+234 802 108 1787‬: Dinah iz not a joking stuff jor. It's very important to me 

What I meant is how's it meant to smell when BV is intact?
17/01/2018, 1:41 pm - ‪+234 812 321 8809‬: Am sure it should vary from girl to girl

17/01/2018, 1:46 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: It wont smell, if it is a yeast infection.
17/01/2018, 1:46 pm - ‪+234 812 321 8809‬: Like breakage of condom in d vagina

2nd question. 
Can much/plenty sex especially with multiple partners cause smell? 
Then sombori once told me that too much use of Gold circle cause it to smell? True? 
That was before they improved it anyways
17/01/2018, 1:46 pm - ‪+234 812 321 8809‬: Yeast???🧐🧐

17/01/2018, 1:47 pm - Dinah: Douching is not advisable
And it is not the best solution, as it can alter the PH balance of the vagina
And even give room to fungus (yeast infection)
17/01/2018, 1:48 pm - ‪+234 812 093 8116‬: Yep
17/01/2018, 1:48 pm - Dinah: Yeah
17/01/2018, 1:49 pm - ‪+234 812 321 8809‬: Nawa ooo, just that am new to all the this terminology.
17/01/2018, 1:49 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: I even heard steaming the vagina isn't also a good idea. As it can alter the PH balance too. But some people believe it helps in the tightening of the vaginal wall.
17/01/2018, 1:50 pm - ‪+234 812 093 8116‬: It's not good
Doing anything asides washing the vaginas with water is wrong
17/01/2018, 1:50 pm - ‪+234 812 321 8809‬: Being a slay queen no b small maintenance.
17/01/2018, 1:50 pm - ‪+234 812 321 8809‬: What do u mean by streaming?
17/01/2018, 1:51 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Steaming is sitting over a bowl of hot water, and covering yourself with a towel, so as not to allow the heat escape.
17/01/2018, 1:51 pm - ‪+234 812 093 8116‬: Can alter the PH balance thereby causing infection
17/01/2018, 1:52 pm - Dinah: It smells like vagina
Its not really the vagina smelling, its the discharge tho
So, it all depends on the discharge
So normally, it should smell like Fresh milk, Like Pap.
17/01/2018, 1:53 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: And taste like rust. It has an acid feel.
17/01/2018, 1:53 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: *acidic
17/01/2018, 1:54 pm - Dinah: Yeah Baby
Very , Because of the PH
17/01/2018, 1:54 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Exactly
17/01/2018, 1:55 pm - ‪+234 701 672 3654‬: Even washing with soap isn't healthy.  The vagina cleanses itself.

17/01/2018, 2:49 pm - Akolab: Ronaldinho the Revolutionary

Ronaldinho was an enabler.

Above all the things that we remember this incendiary footballer for, who announced his official retirement from the game that he brought incalculable joy, it will be this — his qualities as an enabler.

He made so much possible, and ultimately asked so little. He wanted our indulgence, our patience, our glee. In return, the player who is one of the most important figures in FC Barcelona history, Ronaldinho just wanted to play.

Ronaldinho was supposed to be David Beckham, one of the promises made by an ambitious Joan Laporta as he sought power in the FC Barcelona structure. Real Madrid deemed him too unattractive to be a galactico. As with the Chicago Bulls draft pick that was supposed to be Sam Bowie and ended up being Michael Jordan, Barça transferred Ronaldinho from Paris St.-Germain, not the player they wanted but the player they settled for.

At that time, Barça was playing a different kind of football. Louis Van Gaal was coach. The team ended that season sixth in Liga, and was ousted early in European competition. Patrick Kluivert was the star and top scorer, Luis Enrique captain of a squad that included the likes of Puyol, Xavi and Iniesta. Ronaldinho came to the club and had an immediate effect, one that we can only see now, in the clarity of hindsight. He made football a game again, in a way that no player did before and no player has since.

Football talks about a great many “nexts,” but there is never a “next Ronaldinho.” In the debate about Messi vs Ronaldo, and throwing in Right Ronaldo, Ronaldinho was more talented — even if nowhere near any of them statistically — than any of them. He made the impossible seem normal, made the improbable just another day’s work. What other player could destroy Real Madrid in their house and receive a standing ovation in the wake of his savagery? That was Ronaldinho, a player who was impossible to dislike. He would eviscerate a defender and in the next second, be laughing with his arm around that player’s shoulders as they shared a moment. Because how can you be mad at someone for whom everything contains such joy? It was never personal with Ronaldinho. Joy and beauty were his muses, teammates and opposition the agents to realizing it all.

Today, Neymar does some of the same tricks, but there is a butcher’s hardness to his eyes. He often does them because there is no other option, but he often does them to send a message. The foundation is one of cruelty. Messi is an assassin. He loves the game and plays it with unfettered joy, but his visage is that of an accountant, a straight-line path of destruction that isn’t interested in anything except winning.

Ronaldinho was different. As a player, he didn’t really have a position as Frank Rijkaard liberated him. Midfield, forward, winger, it didn’t matter. His powerful base — hips, butt and thighs — enabled him to have the power and ball control of a midfielder. He had the acceleration and overall pace of a forward and the flair of a showman. His smile was as perpetual as the destruction he left in his wake. Sometimes he would shrug off a tackle like a colossus rolling through mere mortals. Other times he would throw an array of tricks at the defender, who had just set his feet in anticipation of a feat of strength. Other times he just ran past them like yet another obstacle to be surmounted.

Football is a game. In the massive millions and desperation of the modern iteration of this sport, we forget that it is a contest that has its roots in a game, a contest of sport. Ronaldinho captured the attention of the world by making football a game, while playing that game better and differently than anyone had seen.

He came at a time when football was just sprouting global wings on the club level, as teams such as Barça became real for people outside of Spain, via satellite and cable broadcasts. Small, third-party broadcasters such as GolTV brought the exploits of him and other stars to devoted U.S. audiences who squinted at oft-grainy images in the quest for their fix. Ronaldinho lit up that world like a rocket, the exact right player for the exact right time. He enabled Laporta, enabled Rijkaard, enabled countless goal scorers. He enabled Messi and Ronaldo, players who wouldn’t be as massive without the structure laid by Ronaldinho, a player who made people follow a football club just to be in some way associated with his genius. He enabled Neymar and the Brazilian flair as Ronaldinho was the epitome of the storied joga bonito, the joy and beauty in the beautiful game.

He catapluted Barça in the ranks of football powerhouses, creating a hunger for victory impelled by the Liga titles and Champions League victory that became an expectation for a hungry fanbase for which the lean years weren’t all that long ago. You tell a contemporary culer that there was a time when making the Champions League set off a delirious celebration, or that the team finished sixth in Liga — they will look at you like you’re from Mars.

Ronaldinho enabled everything, from highlight reels to shirt sales. Like the stands at any Barça match are festooned with Messi shirts, then it was Ronaldinho shirts. He was the best player in the game who was also the best showman in the game. He understood entertainment like a savant impresario, and had a knack for the right thing at the right time. Flashy? Yes. Effective? Not always. But his joy was such that we remembered the four times it came off, rather than the 12 times it didn’t.

Athletics exist in a world of unrealized possibility, defined by the moments when possibility becomes reality. Today’s exceptional athletes are created from work. Messi has ungodly talent, and is the best player in the history of the game. But he works at the game. Hard. In an effort to maximize talent, the modern athlete is at times almost joyless in a singular pursuit of excellence. You can’t dominate in this day and age without an almost monastic devotion to your craft. Ronaldinho was different.

His athletic possibility was defined by magic and beauty, by flair instead of effort in a way that belied his squat, powerful build. For him, possibility was everything as he pulled off yet another thing that nobody had done before. Against Osasuna, in a favorite moment of his, a pass came to him just as Ludovic Giuly was making the run. Control and pass? Giuly would have been offside. Ronaldinho’s back was to Giuly as the ball came to him, so he just redirected it with his backside, directly in the path of Giuly, who scored. It is, to this day, a singular moment of football: classic, showy, improvisational and above all, effective.

And the world saw it all, saw him making everything possible while wearing a Barça shirt, and the club benefited from it. In the pantheon of club legends, for what he did and enabled, he is easily in the top five. Without Ronaldinho, Barça isn’t where it is today, a club that is on course to realize a billion-Euro revenue grab.

Ronaldinho was engaging and endearing, magical and kinda nuts. Most of all, he was unpredictable and enamored of a life that was as easy as he made the game look. People often talk about what might have happened had Ronaldinho applied himself, had he worked at the game and in the gym the way modern players such as Ronaldo do. That would have ruined Ronaldinho, taken away the joy that made him one of the greatest footballers and showmen in the history of the game. Ronaldinho needed joy. Yes, that joy came in nightclubs and being surrounded by friends, excesses that began to affect his game. But that is part of it. He was the wonderful friend who you depend on for a ride to the airport, but they show up late. You would be mad, except somehow he shows up in a Mercedes, and talks you onto the next flight.

Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl told a tale of being told to be ready for a Ronaldinho interview at 11 a.m. that day. The superstar showed up at 8 p.m., but the interview was fantastic, and pique turned into a great memory and lovely copy. That is, and was, Ronaldinho. He wasn’t supposed to maximize his skills by turning a career into a long slog. He was supposed to come, light up the sky like a comet, and then fade.

It was fitting that the next era of Barça, the controlled magnificence of the Guardiola years, meant the end of Ronaldinho. Back then, people scoffed at his lack of dedication, cheered when he was deemed surplus to requirements by new coach Guardiola. But Ronaldinho wouldn’t have worked in that era of football, the modern game of obsessive attention to detail, training until actions become rote, video sessions and play-by-play breakdowns of an opponent. Ronaldinho wasn’t ever supposed to live in that era, nor would he have wanted to. His arc, like one of his remarkable free kicks, was perfectly timed.

He went to AC Milan after Barça, to treat a new set of eyes to the flair and elegant playfulness of a genius. From there it was Brazil, and then futsal courts and legends games where his magic was still apparent, just as joyful and just as effective even as that success was contextual. Not that any of that mattered to his audience, a global, grinning mass captivated by a man deemed to ugly to be a Galactico but who is one of the most beautiful players to ever grace the game.

When Messi debuted with Barça, Ronaldinho was running the show. He enabled Messi to grow, to learn from him the weight of superstardom and joy of the game, wrapped in a commitment to excellence. He handed off the baton to Messi, dusting off a ready-made throne as Messi then escalated what Ronaldinho created. It was perfect.

Football clubs hardly ever retire numbers, for those digits represent a position as much as a player. The No. 9, the perfect 10. But after Messi, who is going to be able to wear the number 10 for Barça? Ronaldinho set up the one player in the history of the game and the club who could wear the No. 10 after he made it sparkle like a diamond. From him to Messi was just another gem of a pass, another genius linkup in the grin-marked path of the ultimate enabler.

17/01/2018, 5:57 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: I talked about this yesterday and let me clarify a bit these changes often occur in the 3rd or last quarter of the year.

Most investment results in Q1 are usually as a result of interplay of Q4 of the previous year
17/01/2018, 5:59 pm - Chika Nels: Amen o😅
17/01/2018, 6:01 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: So most people that invested in stocks and equities late last year will be enjoying huge boom yields at the moment. If you remember late last year during one of my chats with @2348167141023 and the other BitCoin guys on here, I was saying BitCoin isn't advisable cos it is going through a fast rise and it's highly volatile. I then advised on investing in money market or if you're risk savvy to invest in stocks
17/01/2018, 6:02 pm - ‪+234 816 817 6267‬: Now that we know what volatility can do to investments

17/01/2018, 6:37 pm - Kembele: *DON’T WRITE YOUR SURNAME BEFORE YOUR FIRST NAME* 

People must understand that the arrangement of names is standard across the globe. When you’re asked to mention or write your name, call/write your first name first before any other names and the name that comes last is presumed to be your last name/surname. For example, if you’re James and your surname is John, in writing your name, write James John not the other way round.

All over the globe, the standard practice is:
First name 
Middle name(s) if any 
Surname or Last Name

However, if you write your surname first, always put comma so that readers can identify it as such. For example, if you write *John, James* a reader will know that John is your surname and James is your first name. 

Another acceptable practice is — you write your surname in caps and keep the first name in lower keys. For instance, *JOHN James* will communicate to every reader that your surname is John and your first name is James. 

Also, if you want to introduce yourself with your titles, mention the first name first in the sequence. For example; I am
*Prof/Dr./Rev./Mr. James John*
It tells a reader that James is your first name while John is your last. In instances where you mention your surname first after your title, don’t add your first name. For example, “Hello, I am Mr. John” don’t add your first name James. 

People are losing juicy jobs due to these minor mistakes they make at job interviews. Stop mentioning your surname before your first name. Surnames always come last that’s why in some jurisdictions, they specifically call it your *Last Name*.

2. Set aside one hour every morning for personal development matters. Meditate, visualize your day, read inspirational texts to set the tone of your day, listen to motivational tapes or read great literature. Take this quiet period to vitalize and energize your spirit for the productive day ahead. Watch the sun rise once a week or be with nature. Starting the day off well is a powerful strategy for self-renewal and personal effectiveness. 

3. Do not allow those things that matter the most in your life be at the mercy of activities that matter the least. Every day, take the time to ask yourself the question "is this the best use of my time and energy?" Time management is life management so guard your time with great care.

4. Use the rubber band method to condition your mind to focus solely on the most positive elements in your life. Place a rubber band around your wrist. Each time a negative, energy sapping thought enters your mind, snap the rubber band. Through the power of conditioning, your mind will associate pain with negative thinking and you will soon possess a strongly positive mindset. 

5. Always answer the phone with enthusiasm in your voice and show your appreciation for the caller. Good phone manners are essential. To convey authority on the line, stand up. This will instill further confidence in your voice.

18/01/2018, 5:56 pm - Akolab: In the early 2000s, Vladimir Putin seemed to be a pragmatic politician. However, since then his actions have become weighed down with an anti-Western ideology nourished by references to certain conservative Russian philosophers. Could he have taken a step backwards when he became a point of reference for all the “non-aligned” and conservatives of the planet?

When he acceded to the Russian presidency at the beginning of the year 2000, Vladimir Putin solemnly declared: “I am opposed to the restoration of any kind of official state ideology in Russia (“Russia at the Turn of the Millennium”).

His objective was to stabilize a country seriously affected by the economic and social crisis and eradicate the wounds of the recent past. He attempted to reconcile the red and white memories of the country by mixing symbols of tsarism and the Soviet Union.

This politics of harmony was clearly an ideological act since it resulted in restraining any freely critical assessment of the USSR. The rampant return of Stalinism in the country today is proof of this. Instead of facing up to the past, Putin proposed burying it in order to move forward.

His first term in office from 2000 to 2004 was marked by a pragmatic attitude that aimed at helping Russia meet western “standards” and which was also pro-European. Putin frequently quoted Emmanuel Kant. However, after 2004, the President’s rhetoric became harsher. It played a role in the Baltic states’ accession to NATO and the European Union. He saw the former satellite nations shaken by “color revolutions” (Georgia at the end of 2003 and the Ukraine in late 2004). A former member of the KGB, Putin regarded this solely as the result of manipulation by the American secret service organizations.

By the end of his second term in office in 2008, his rhetoric had become colored by anti-Western tones. He started quoting from the speeches of the Russian émigré philosopher Ivan Ilyin (1883-1954) who criticized European democracies and dreamed of a “guide” for Russia who “knows what needs to be done.” According to Ilyin: “The guide serves instead of making a career; fights instead of playing a secondary role; strikes the enemy instead of uttering hollow phrases; leads instead of selling out to foreigners” (Our Tasks, not translated). A hollow, flattering portrait of the person who is to become a national leader.

However, it was necessary to wait for Vladimir Putin’s third term - after the Medvedev intermezzo (2008-2012) - to be able to witness the renaissance of a Russian ideology. After the year 2012 had been devoted to putting the opponents to heel, 2013 was the one for “turning conservative”. Putin denounced the “Many Euro-Atlantic countries [that] have moved away from ethical principles and their traditional identity: national, cultural, religious and even sexual. Policies are being pursued that place a multi-child family and a same-sex partnership on the same level, a faith in God and a belief in Satan.

The excesses of political correctness are leading to the point where people are talking seriously about registering parties whose goal is legalizing the propaganda of paedophilia. People in many European countries are embarrassed or afraid to talk about their religious affiliations.” The President concluded that that this would result in a “demographic and moral crisis”. Wishing to give form to the fight against this tendency, he called for the “defence of traditional values” and accepted that: “This is a conservative position.” Incidentally, he quoted the anti-Western philosopher Constantin Leontiev (1831-1891) who assured that Europe had fallen into decadence and, in contrast, praised the “flourishing complexity” of the Russian Empire. And could Russian make a Europe that had fallen into amnesia aware of its Christian roots once again? This discourse fell on the ears of certain European politicians.

The second pillar of Putinism, in line with certain Slavophil thinkers such as Nikolay Danilevsky (1822-1885), the author of the classic Russia and Europe, became concrete in his defence of a “Russian path” that was both cultural and political. In March 2014, the Kremlin annexed the Crimean Peninsula - as a reaction to the revolution in the Ukraine, which the official Russian media interpreted as a Fascist “putsch”. At the time of the major speech celebrating the event on 18 March 2014, Vladimir Putin asserted that: “We have every reason to assume that the infamous policy of the containment of Russia, which was pursued in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, continues today. They are constantly trying to sweep us into a corner because we have an independent position, because we maintain it and because we call a spade a spade and do not engage in hypocrisy. But there are limits.” This is clearly an expression of a revanchist programme.

Finally, the Eurasian Economic Union came into force. Reverting to the concept of Eurasia, theorized by an intellectual trend in the 1920s and very much in fashion in the 1990s, this project foresees the constitution of a single market of 180 million people. It unites Russia, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia, Armenia and Kirgizstan and expects other states from Central Asia to join. This launched the concept of a community of continental states to rival Europe, which was considered stillborn, and dominating Atlanticism. And, Putin therefore quoted Lev Gumilyov a Eurasist of the 20th century.

Conservatism against the moral degeneration of the west, the defence of a “Russian path” in the face of hostile manoeuvres from abroad, the affirmation of a Eurasian power as a counterbalance to the Atlanticist sphere - all of these vectors for the new ideology of the Kremlin were forcefully affirmed by the highest state instances. They were taught to high-level government officials and were the subject of symposia and television programmes. In 2015, at a time when the Russian economy was suffering, these ideological fragments were intended to create adhesion. It is quite obvious that these loans from a certain kind of Russian philosophy - its most anti-Western, warmongering and pseudo-scientific element - has, above all, a pragmatic effect and that Putin is in no way a philosopher-president. Nevertheless, the proof of the effectiveness of this ideological patchwork can be seen in its influence that has become global. In France, politicians and intellectuals show themselves pro or contra. A sector of public opinion - anti-American and anti-system or conservative - recognizes the strong man who does not mince his words in the Russian politician.

A new stage has been reached with the intervention in Syria that was preceded by a speech at the United Nations that was more radical than ever in its anti-Western sentiments. How far will Putinism take us? That has become a question that no longer only concerns the Russian people.

6. Throughout the day we all get inspiration and excellent ideas. Keep a set of cards (the size of business cards; available at most stationary stores) in your wallet along with a pencil to jot down these insights. When you get home, put the ideas in a central place such as a coil notepad and review them from time to time. As noted by Oliver Wendell Holmes: "Man's mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions."

19/01/2018, 7:47 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: I didn't make it out but I tried. A failed trial that sent I and a Man into trial and  the  plaintif being the judge of the accused.
It was late we were already tied to stake.
He said Woman...... I respond with silence while my eyes were secreting ponds.
He said ur silence is loud enough  for me.
He said on this stake your heart I shall take.
I had a revelation that you are the genesis of the word called love  
You can't even be the exodus of it. I would sing hymns and praises if u love me back so strong I would call u rock of ages and I will be the old rugged cross. Let's take this to church and exchange vows, love has crippled me I will kneel b4 u but has love deafened you and made you dumb?
 I am only a simple Man falling victim of regular love while watching you fall for iregular love. I am persistent to make this consistent. I insist to love you. I master 4 letters L O V E and 4 words, "I love this Woman." Let's take it forward and be fast, lets fastforeward like we have four feet cos this love I can't forfeit. God forbid, that a simple man becomes so complicated for you. You and I are we so let him and her be  they, on this day. Today I surrender amunisions of love that my heart may survive this battle and let this internal war end.
My King, Set me free! Who gives a sentence b4 judgement, I will express these words in one sentence, i have been sentenced to a life time of loving this Woman.
What I did for love

His lips could not embrace he wasn't willing  so they insisted he will, and torsed him like mere weels against his will. He rolled over to me and said,Woman it is time. 
I hoped for a miracle unseen so i ran for the oracle  i see and appealed to its conscinece portraying no patience i said Oh king this Man and all women and children be set free, let me be baite, it is not up for debate.  
 or I lift this Oracle that it's pieces shall embrace dust and kiss these sands of your land.  
1 man, women and children were set free and travelled far and wide  while i held a king, kings Men and Men hostage with an Oracle. Thats how a clan of thousands of Women, children and 1 Man was originated in one land
What I did for love.

20/01/2018, 9:52 am - Chika Nels: *e-Learn Hub fun hacks*

1. Put a sticker with a fake PIN number on your debit card. If you lose it and someone tries to use it 3+ times, the machine will eat the card.

2. Didn't finish your paper? Copy and paste a bunch of random symbols in a Word document and send it. Your teacher will think the file was damaged.

3. Confusing Wikipedia article? Click "Simple English" on the left list of languages and it'll whisk you to a simplified version!

4. Secretaries, tech support and janitors are the true power in an office. Make friends, remember birthdays and you can get anything you need!

5. If you drop an earring, ring, or small screw simply turn off the lights and look with a flashlight. They'll light right up.

6. Want to find a job after college? Be friends with as many people as possible in your field but on pace to graduate 1-2 years ahead of you.

7. Put that you were Time’s 2006 person of the year on your resume/CV. In 2006, Time made "Everyone" the person of the year😁😁

8. You can clear a room full of cigarette smoke in about a minute simply by spinning a wet towel around.

9. If you ever go to a zoo, wear the same colors as the employees do. The animals will come right up to you instead of backing away.

_splendid day ahead!_

20/01/2018, 7:47 pm - ‪+234 813 061 4554‬: According to Bodmas, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction.
Therefore,
(-2*3)=-6
So you have 
2-6+3=-1
20/01/2018, 7:47 pm - ‪+234 909 008 1261‬: 2-(2*3)+ 3
2-(6)+3
-4+3
= -1.

Happy new year to you once again.
January is gradually coming to an end. Many of us working would soon receive our January salary. Many of us working and not working  have always thought about the concept of saving and investment but have never really gotten around understanding what to invest in and how to invest.

Kindly click on this link to direct you to an online class I attended that helped demystify investment.

*LIFE IS A SHOVEL OF DIRT:*

*One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.*
*He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down.*
*A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.*
*As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and happily trotted off!*

*MORAL:*
*Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.*
*Each of our troubles is a steppingstone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.*

*Remember the five simple rules to be happy:*

*1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.*

*2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happens.*

*3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.*

*4. Give more.*

*5. Expect less from people but more from yourself.*

*You have two choices... smile and close this page, or pass this along to someone else to share the lesson.*

God bless us on this journey we call life...

8. Always remember the key principle that the quality of your life is the quality of your communication. This means the way you communicate with others and, more importantly, the way you communicate with yourself. What you focus on is what you get. If you look for the positive this is what you get. This is a fundamental law of Nature. 

9. Stay on purpose, not on outcome. In other words, do the task because it is what you love to do or because it will help someone or is a valuable exercise. Don't do it for the money or the recognition. Those will come naturally. This is the way of the world. 

Good morning.

If you lost an Android phone in your house and it's on vibrate, you can find it by going to Google Play>Android device manager>'Ring'

Putting your phone on airplane mode will stop ads while playing games.

If you accidentally close a tab, ctrl+shift+t reopens it.

To listen to a song on Youtube on repeat without having to keep pressing ‘replay’ at the end, add ‘repeat’ between ‘www.Youtube’ and ‘.com’.

On iOS 7, you can now block people from calling or texting you by going to settings>messages>blocked

Wanna write essays and bibliographies like a PRO: Get the info from Wikipedia, and cite the sources listed at the bottom.

An iPad charger will charge your iPhone much faster.

To skip a YouTube ad, just change 'youtube' to 'youtubeskip' in the URL of any video.😎

10. Laugh for five minutes in the mirror each morning. Steve Martin does. Laughter activates many beneficial chemicals within the body that place us into a very joyous state. Laughter also returns the body to a state of balance. Laughter therapy has been regularly used to heal persons with varied ailments and is a wonderful tonic for life's ills. While the average 4 year old laughs 500 times a day, the average adult is lucky to laugh 15 times a day. Revitalize the habit of laughter, it will put far more living into your life. 

11. Light a candle beside you when you are reading in the evening. It is most relaxing and creates a wonderful, soothing atmosphere. Make your home an oasis from the frenzied world outside. Fill it with great music, great books and great friends.

23/01/2018, 4:03 pm - Chika Nels: *_e-Learn Hub Sucess tips cont'd_*

13. Learn to meditate effectively. The mind is naturally a very noisy machine which wants to move from one subject to another like an unchained monkey. One must learn to restrain and discipline it if one is to achieve anything of substance and to be peaceful. Meditation for twenty minutes in the morning and twenty minutes in the evening will certainly provide you with exceptional results if regularly practiced for six months. Learned sages of the East have been advancing the many benefits of meditation for over 5000 years. 

14. Learn to be still. The average person doesn't spend even 30 minutes a month in total silence and tranquility. Develop the skill of sitting quietly, enjoying the powerful silence for at least ten minutes a day. Simply think about what is important to you in your life. Reflect on your mission. Silence indeed is golden. As the Zen master once said, it is the space between the bars that holds the cage.

23/01/2018, 4:43 pm - Chika Nels: Being successful often means learning from those who have already achieved their goals. Having a mentor is an amazing blessing to an entrepreneur, but not everyone can find one in person.
23/01/2018, 4:45 pm - Sammah: If you haven’t yet found your personal business guru, here are 21 tips for young or aspiring entrepreneur to help get you started.
23/01/2018, 4:45 pm - Chika Nels: 1. Challenge yourself. 
Richard Branson says his biggest motivation is to keep challenging himself. He treats life like one long university education, where he can learn more every day. You can too!
23/01/2018, 4:45 pm - Sammah: 2. Do work you care about. 
There’s no doubt that running a business take a lot of time. Steve Jobs noted that the only way to be satisfied in your life is to do work that you truly believe in.
23/01/2018, 4:46 pm - Chika Nels: 3. Take the risk. 
We never know the outcome of our efforts unless we actually do it. Jeff Bezos said it helped to know that he wouldn’t regret failure, but he would regret not trying.
23/01/2018, 4:46 pm - Sammah: 4. Believe in yourself.
As Henry Ford famously said, “Whether you think you can, or think you can’t, you’re right.” Believe that you can succeed, and you’ll find ways through different obstacles. If you don’t, you’ll just find excuses.
23/01/2018, 4:46 pm - Chika Nels: 5. Have a vision. 
The founder and CEO of Tumblr, David Karp, notes that an entrepreneur is someone who has a vision for something and a desire to create it. Keep your vision clear at all times.
23/01/2018, 4:46 pm - Sammah: 6. Find good people. 
Who you’re with is who you become. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, noted that the fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be.
23/01/2018, 4:47 pm - Chika Nels: 7. Face your fears. 
Overcoming fear isn’t easy, but it must be done. Arianna Huffington once said that she found fearlessness was like a muscle -- the more she exercised it, the stronger it became.
23/01/2018, 4:47 pm - Sammah: 8. Take action. 
The world is full of great ideas, but success only comes through action. Walt Disney once said that the easiest way to get started is to quit talking and start doing. That’s true for your success as well.
23/01/2018, 4:47 pm - Babajide Martins: I'm not understanding
23/01/2018, 4:47 pm - Chika Nels: 9. Do the time. 
No one succeeds immediately, and everyone was once a beginner. As Steve Jobs wisely noted, “if you look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.” Don’t be afraid to invest time in your company.
23/01/2018, 4:48 pm - Sammah: 10. Manage energy, not time.
Your energy limits what you can do with your time, so manage it wisely.
23/01/2018, 4:48 pm - Chika Nels: 11. Build a great team. 
No one succeeds in business alone, and those who try will lose to a great team every time. Build your own great team to bolster your success.
23/01/2018, 4:48 pm - Sammah: 12. Hire character. 
As you build your team, hire for character and values. You can always train someone on skills, but you can’t make someone’s values fit your company after the fact.
23/01/2018, 4:48 pm - Chika Nels: 13. Plan for raising capital.
Richard Harroch, a venture capitalist, has this advice for upcoming entrepreneurs: “It’s almost always harder to raise capital than you thought it would be, and it always takes longer. So plan for that.”
23/01/2018, 4:49 pm - Sammah: 14. Know your goals. 
Ryan Allis, co-founder of iContact, pointed out that having the end in mind every day ensures you’re working toward it. Set goals and remind yourself of them each day.
23/01/2018, 4:49 pm - Chika Nels: 15. Learn from mistakes. 
Many entrepreneurs point to mistakes as being their best teacher. When you learn from your mistakes, you move closer to success -- even though you initially failed.
23/01/2018, 4:50 pm - Sammah: 16. Know your customer. 
Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy’s, cited knowing your customer as one of his three keys to success.
23/01/2018, 4:50 pm - Chika Nels: 17. Learn from complaints. 
Bill Gates once said that your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning. Let unhappy customers teach you where the holes in your service are.
23/01/2018, 4:51 pm - Sammah: 18. Ask for customers’ input. 
Assuming what customers want or need will never lead to success. You must ask them directly, and then carefully listen to what they say.
23/01/2018, 4:51 pm - Chika Nels: 19. Spend wisely. 
When you spend money on your business, be careful to spend it wisely. It’s easy to spend too much on foolish things and run out of capital too soon.
23/01/2018, 4:51 pm - Sammah: 20. Understand your industry. 
Tony Hsieh, the founder of Zappos, once said, “Don’t play games you don’t understand, even if you see lots of other people making money from them.” Truly understanding your industry is key to having success.
23/01/2018, 4:52 pm - Chika Nels: 21. Deliver more than expected.
Google's Larry Page encourages entrepreneurs to deliver more than customers expect. It’s a great way to get noticed in your industry and build a loyal following of advocates.

24/01/2018, 1:19 am - Chika Nels: *e-Learn Hub Secrets of Success continued*


15. Enhance your will-power; it is likely one of the best training programs you can invest in. Here are some ideas to strengthen your will and become a stronger person: 

a. Do not let your mind float like a piece of paper in the wind. Work hard to keep it focused at all times. When doing a task, think of nothing else. When walking to work, count the steps that it takes to get all the way to the office. This is not easy but your mind will soon understand that you hold its reins and not vice versa. Your mind must eventually become as still as a candle flame in a corner where there is no draft.

b. Your will is like a muscle. You must first exercise it and then push before it gets stronger. This necessarily involves short term pain but be assured that the improvements will come and will touch your character in a most positive way. When you are hungry, wait another hour before your meal. When you are labouring over a difficult task and your mind is prompting you to pick up the latest magazine for a break or to get up and go talk to a friend, curb the impulse. Soon you will be able to sit for hours in a precisely concentrated state. Sir Issac Newton, one of the greatest classical physicists the world has produced, once said: "if I have done the public any service, it is due to patient thought." Newton had a remarkable ability to sit quietly and think without interruption for very long periods of time. If he can develop this so can you. 

c. You can also build your will-power by restraint in your conduct with others. Speak less (use the 60/40 Rule = listen 60% of the time and speak a mere 40%, if that). This will not only make you more popular but you will learn much wisdom as everyone we meet, every day has something to teach us. Also restrain the urge to gossip or to condemn someone who you feel has made a mistake. Stop complaining and develop a cheerful, vital and strong personality. You will greatly influence others. 

d. When a negative thought comes to your mind, immediately replace it with one that is positive. Positive always dominates over the negative and your mind has to be conditioned to think only the best thoughts. Negative thinking is a conditioned process whereby the negative patterns are established over and over. Rid yourself of any limitations and become a powerful positive thinker. 

16. Make an effort to be humorous throughout the day. Not only is it beneficial from a physical viewpoint but it diffuses tension in difficult circumstances and creates an excellent atmosphere wherever you are. It was recently reported that members of the Tauripan tribe of South America have a ritual where they awake in the middle of the night to tell each other jokes. Even tribesmen in the deepest sleep wake to enjoy the laugh and then return to their state of slumber in seconds.

Wa maa lo🌝
24/01/2018, 8:05 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Good morning all
In order to ensure that none of us becomes a victim of food poisoning again, I've decided to share some tips. 
To our friend who just came out of the hospital, I'm glad you are better now.
24/01/2018, 8:05 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 1. Wash your hands

Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water (warm or cold) and dry them before handling food, after handling raw food – including meat, fish, eggs and vegetables – and after touching the bin, going to the toilet, blowing your nose or touching animals (including pets).
24/01/2018, 8:07 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 2. Wash worktops

Wash worktops before and after preparing food, particularly after they've been touched by raw meat (including poultry), raw eggs, fish and vegetables. You don't need to use antibacterial soaps cause warm , soapy water is fine.
24/01/2018, 8:08 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 3. Wash dishcloths

Wash dishcloths and tea towels regularly, and let them dry before you use them again. Dirty, damp cloths are the perfect place for germs to spread - fungus especially which is one dangerous causative agent
24/01/2018, 8:09 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 4. Use separate chopping boards

Use a separate chopping board to prepare raw food, such as meat and fish. This is to avoid contaminating ready-to-eat foods with harmful bacteria that can be present in raw food before it has been cooked. 
24/01/2018, 8:09 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 5. Keep raw meat separate

It's especially important to keep raw meat away from ready-to-eat foods, such as salad, fruit and bread. This is because these foods won't be cooked before you eat them, so any bacteria that get onto the foods from the raw meat won't be killed.
24/01/2018, 8:10 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 6. Store raw meat on the bottom shelf

Always cover raw meat and store it on the bottom shelf of the fridge, where it can't touch or drip onto other foods.
24/01/2018, 8:12 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 7. Cook food thoroughly

Make sure every form of meat is cooked until steaming hot, with no pink meat inside. Don't wash raw meat  (including chicken and turkey) before cooking, as this can spread bacteria around your kitchen. 

Freezing raw chicken reduces the levels of campylobacter bacteria but doesn't eliminate them completely. The safest way to kill all traces of campylobacter is by cooking chicken thoroughly. 
24/01/2018, 8:13 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 8. Avoid overfilling your fridge – if it's too full, air can't circulate properly, which can affect the overall temperature.
24/01/2018, 8:13 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 9. Cool leftovers quickly

If you have cooked food that you're not going to eat straight away, cool it as quickly as possible (within 90 minutes) and store it in the fridge or freezer. Use any leftovers from the fridge within 2 days.
24/01/2018, 8:15 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: 10. Respect 'use-by' dates

Don't eat food that's past its use-by date, even if it looks and smells okay. Use-by dates are based on scientific tests that show how quickly harmful bugs can develop in the packaged food.

Especially in our country where these dates are even adjusted.  Please check expiry date before buying your gala
24/01/2018, 8:16 am - ‪+234 703 114 2632‬: Good morning beloved people. Thank you all for your warm welcome
24/01/2018, 8:16 am - ‪+234 703 114 2632‬: I really appreciate. I believe it is a privilege to be here
24/01/2018, 8:17 am - ‪+234 703 114 2632‬: Thank you all once again
24/01/2018, 8:20 am - Kembele: Sorry dear 🙁

24/01/2018, 8:21 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Jara
Don't underestimate the power of washing your hands. Wash your hands immediately you get home and before you touch any edibles. 

Avoid eating contaminated fruits. No don't cut out the rotten part and feast on the good part. Dispose all. Don't buy rotten tomato. That whitish mould on it is caused by a fungus which might not be harmful ingesting in small quantities but will definitely be harmful on the long run. 

Don't touch your meal after touching money. You don't know where the money has been. 

Have a beautiful day ahead
24/01/2018, 8:22 am - ‪+234 816 969 9291‬: Additional jara

24/01/2018, 9:01 am - Kembele: *HYPOMENORRHOEA*

Hypomenorrhoea or scanty flow is an abnormal menstruation where the flow is extremely little or one in which the duration of blood flow is less than two days. In other words, your period can last for 3 or 4 days or more but if the blood flow is too little and below the expected minimum amount of blood flow, it is known as hypomenorrhoea. 

Similarly, if your flow comes and doesn't last up to 2 days (at least 2 days), then hypomenorrhoea is what you have.

24/01/2018, 10:49 am - Dinah: *Health Focus*
 _Natural Healing power that lies Dominant within you_

Good health is the most valuable possession you could possibly have 
This simple truth applies as much to a newborn baby as to an elderly man,  a mother,  a doctor,  the common person on the street or the president of a country.
24/01/2018, 10:51 am - Dinah: Whenever your body becomes sick or does not perform up to what you feel to be normal,  you may experience a state of discomfort,  fear or depression that can only be remedied by restoring your body's former health and vitality .
24/01/2018, 10:53 am - Dinah: To truly feel feel comfortable within yourself and in your surroundings,  you must be able to heal every kind of "dis-ease" that you experience
24/01/2018, 10:53 am - Dinah: You are indeed capable of healing yourself
24/01/2018, 10:54 am - Dinah: Your state of health is but a reflection of how you perceive yourself and your world.
24/01/2018, 10:55 am - ‪+234 816 633 5063‬: Dis-ease 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
24/01/2018, 10:56 am - Dinah: The United force of your body,  mind and spirit continually seeks to provide you with nourishment, vitality and happiness
24/01/2018, 10:57 am - Dinah: *The Body*uses food, water and air to renew and sustain itself
24/01/2018, 10:57 am - Dinah: *The Mind* chooses a task that keeps it creative and active
24/01/2018, 10:58 am - Chika Nels: 🤗🤗
24/01/2018, 10:59 am - Dinah: *The spirit* loos for a way to expand itself by generating waves of love, peace and freedom to share happiness with the world as a means of gaining fulfillment.
24/01/2018, 11:01 am - Dinah: So,  In summary 
 *Everything you do and experience, physically, mentally, and emotionally, has a profound bearing on your entire being* 
Question is: What are you doing to heal yourself?
24/01/2018, 11:06 am - Dinah: *WHO* defines _health_ as the complete mental,  social and physical well-being of an individual and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity
24/01/2018, 11:12 am - Dinah: *Bottom line*
Stay healthy in All of these ways as best as you can.
Maintain your Inner peace.
You are tripartite, (Body, Mind and Soul) 
Once you can keep these three forms on check ,Then you can say, You are HEALTHY

When you feel the urge to drink or smoke, go for a run, do 20 sit ups, etc. You'll start to associate quitting the habit with being fit.

Eating your food slowly will help you lose weight, enjoy your food, reduce stress, and lead to better digestion.

Buy bananas in various degrees of ripeness that way, you'll have a ripe one to eat every day!

If you're ever feeling sleepy, hold your breath as long as you can, and then breath out slowly. It increases your heart rate.

Laughter and relaxation are just as vital to Health & Fitness as eating right and exercising.

The best way to cure hiccups is to TRY to hiccup😁

24/01/2018, 10:43 pm - Akolab: *Day of bombshells 💣 takes Mueller probe to critical point 😱*

Finally, inexorably, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has clawed all the way up to Donald Trump himself.  
A stunning barrage of revelations on Tuesday suggested that at least one strand of Mueller's Russia probe is racing toward its end game, emphasizing the gravity of the situation facing the White House and the potential vulnerability of the President.  
Mueller's request to question Trump, and news that his team has already interviewed fired FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, indicate that the special counsel has a clear picture of where he is headed in what could turn into an obstruction of justice case, legal experts said.

The revelations came at a time when there were new signs that Trump is still pushing up against constitutional norms in his conduct toward judicial authorities usually seen as independent of the President.  
First, the current FBI Director Christopher Wray threatened to quit, a source familiar with the situation told CNN, after coming under pressure from Sessions, to clean out senior leadership figures dating from the Comey era who the President believes are biased against him.   
Following this, the Washington Post reported that Trump had asked then acting FBI director Andrew McCabe who he voted for in the 2016 election in an introductory Oval Office meeting and criticized his wife's Democratic affiliation, in a move that infringed customary treatment of a civil servant.  
And there are signs Rick Gates, the former Trump campaign staffer who pleaded not guilty in October to eight charges of money laundering and failing to register foreign lobbying and other business, may be ready to cooperate with Mueller.  
As if this drama wasn't enough, efforts by Republicans to discredit the Russia probe gathered pace, as the White House said Trump was ready to declassify a memo written by GOP committee staff in the House claiming misconduct by FBI officials investigating the President.

26/01/2018, 12:53 pm - Chika Nels: *_e-Learn Hub secrets of success continued_*

15. Enhance your will-power; it is likely one of the best training programs you can invest in. Here are some ideas to strengthen your willa and become a stronger person: 

a. Do not let your mind float like a piece of paper in the wind. Work hard to keep it focused at all times. When doing a task, think of nothing else. When walking to work, count the steps that it takes to get all the way to the office. This is not easy but your mind will soon understand that you hold its reins and not vice versa. Your mind must eventually become as still as a candle flame in a corner where there is no draft.

b. Your will is like a muscle. You must first exercise it and then push before it gets stronger. This necessarily involves short term pain but be assured that the improvements will come and will touch your character in a most positive way. When you are hungry, wait another hour before your meal. When you are labouring over a difficult task and your mind is prompting you to pick up the latest magazine for a break or to get up and go talk to a friend, curb the impulse. Soon you will be able to sit for hours in a precisely concentrated state. Sir Issac Newton, one of the greatest classical physicists the world has produced, once said: "if I have done the public any service, it is due to patient thought." Newton had a remarkable ability to sit quietly and think without interruption for very long periods of time. If he can develop this so can you. 

c. You can also build your will-power by restraint in your conduct with others. Speak less (use the 60/40 Rule = listen 60% of the time and speak a mere 40%, if that). This will not only make you more popular but you will learn much wisdom as everyone we meet, every day has something to teach us. Also restrain the urge to gossip or to condemn someone who you feel has made a mistake. Stop complaining and develop a cheerful, vital and strong personality. You will greatly influence others. 

d. When a negative thought comes to your mind, immediately replace it with one that is positive. Positive always dominates over the negative and your mind has to be conditioned to think only the best thoughts. Negative thinking is a conditioned process whereby the negative patterns are established over and over. Rid yourself of any limitations and become a powerful positive thinker.

26/01/2018, 9:48 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: There is a project that I came up with which is aimed at reawakening the minds of the youths to charge us up to becoming productive and vital members of the society.. It would be an interactive session where young people like us would be discussant addressing topics and issues relating to the youth.. So I thought about the hub as we have great minds and generational changers here from the quality of the conversations we have  .. So the initiative which I named THE PODIUM would serves as a means for those conversations we discuss on the hub to be shared to other young people.. 
Similarly I reasoned that we would also be in need of the social media to help drive the initiative better owing to the mass appeal that the social media have among the youth..
There would also be a segment to showcase relatively unknown young people who are doing great stuffs in the society .. We would be using the platform to create more exposure for them...
I would appreciate your comments as well as questions...

26/01/2018, 10:17 pm - ‪+234 808 804 6609‬: I must appreciate everyone for your remarks.. So I guess to a large extent I guess everyone is fine with the idea...
So coming to how we would get involved is from the point of the faculty members..
The faculty members would be individuals who would help to push the ideas.
For this idea we would be needing someone  who help drive the social media , a graphic person, an idea moderator, a research person... Etc whatever skill set you have that you no can help move the idea forward...I hope we pilot it in Lagos then potentially move to other parts of the country especially where we have hub members
26/01/2018, 10:18 pm - Chika Nels: Of course, influence and power. 
That was how he started, that's how he was  working until he reached the top far above any potential competition.

27/01/2018, 11:01 am - Akolab: Bill Gates key note address to the young graduates for career choice and path to follow. Dear class of 2017, congratulations ! You've just accomplished something I never managed to earn, that is  a college degree. If I were starting out today and looking for the same kind of opportunity to make a big impact in the world, I would consider three fields. One is ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. We have only begun to tap into the ways it will make people's lives more productive and creative. The second is ENERGY, because making it clean, affordable, and reliable will be essential for fighting poverty and climate change. The third is the BIOSCIENCES, which are ripe with opportunities to help people live longer, healthier lives. But some things in life are true no matter what career you choose. Recognize and appreciate people's different talents. The sooner you can do this, if you don't already, the richer your life will be. I encourage you to surround yourself with people who challenge you, teach you, and push you to be your best. If I could give you a graduation present, it would be a copy of 'The Better Angels of Our Natures' by Steven Pinker. Good luck to all of you.
