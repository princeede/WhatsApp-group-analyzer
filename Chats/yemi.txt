12/8/16, 5:17 PM - olayinka olawale: I think you have to build your friendship to an extent
Get to know and understand her
From there, you can decipher things you can ask and she'd be cool with and things you can't ask
That's as per casual friendship
I can't give you any particular boundary for girls cos boundaries that will work for girl A might not work for girl B
12/8/16, 5:19 PM - Yemi LVCU: Enh! Enh!

1/5/17, 9:00 PM - olayinka olawale: Wife Is A WifeA newly married couple was walking through a garden, suddenly a dog ran towards them. They both knew the dog would bite them but the husband lifted his wife to let the dog bite him rather than his sweetheart. The dog stopped before them, unsure what to do, barked a little while & ran away.The husband put his wife down, expecting a hug & a few kind words of gratitude from her. But his wife shouted "I've seen people throwing stones & sticks at dogs, this is the first time I am seeing someone trying to throw his wife at a dog"Moral : A Wife is a Wife"No One ELSE Can MIS-UNDERSTAND a Husband Better than a Wife."Husband it is well. Take heart it is part of the challenges of being a husband. It is price all husband must pay..Good evening

Praying more for 'zeal'
1/7/17, 12:07 PM - olayinka olawale: Zeal in the sense that there's no more LVCU to keep it coming
I really can't rely on the churches here

1/7/17, 12:17 PM - Yemi LVCU: Remember the time I asked what friendship meant to you? And friends u made or still kept in Lvcu? This is why I asked cos after school we all face realities...even when in school sef, during breaks, we see the need to keep the fire burning...that's why we talk about personal altar, study, vigils reaches etc

2/3/17, 1:18 PM - olayinka olawale: Oya start
2/3/17, 1:18 PM - olayinka olawale: This *friendship*
2/3/17, 1:24 PM - Yemi LVCU: <Media omitted>
2/3/17, 1:25 PM - Yemi LVCU: 🤔?
2/3/17, 1:27 PM - olayinka olawale: Yea, the study
2/3/17, 1:28 PM - Yemi LVCU: So where do we go from...?
Yeah...do you have any misconceptions about the Acts 2 event and what really happened as to whether tongues is another man's language somewhere in the world?
2/3/17, 1:29 PM - olayinka olawale: No, I don't
2/3/17, 1:29 PM - olayinka olawale: I was giving you instances of what I saw in the mosque  but that's cleared
2/3/17, 1:30 PM - Yemi LVCU: So what will our study touch on?..
2/3/17, 1:31 PM - Yemi LVCU: How did we handle it?
2/3/17, 1:31 PM - Yemi LVCU: Were gonna touch on scriptures and verses.
2/3/17, 1:31 PM - olayinka olawale: Is it like you want me to recap it or you don't remember?
2/3/17, 1:33 PM - Yemi LVCU: If you were the one asked by someone giving that instance...how would you answer them by way of *teaching*?
2/3/17, 1:39 PM - Yemi LVCU: If VNs will suffice, don't hesitate to send em in. They'll even make it easier.
2/3/17, 1:40 PM - Yemi LVCU: Hope you're with a Bible?
2/3/17, 1:40 PM - Yemi LVCU: You have ba3 enuf too?
2/3/17, 1:40 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok
I'd start by telling them that somethings come in disguise
The fact that a muslim spoke in tongues doesn't mean he/she is filled with the holy ghost.
And the person might not have an understanding as to what he or she is saying. 
One has to be filled cos the spirit has to give one utterance and the only way to speaking genuinely in tongues is to be born again and filled
Then refer he or she to acts 2
2/3/17, 1:41 PM - Yemi LVCU: OK... Any other place to refer 'em to?
2/3/17, 1:43 PM - Yemi LVCU: You there?
2/3/17, 1:45 PM - Yemi LVCU: Acts 16:16-18.
2/3/17, 1:46 PM - olayinka olawale: Yea
2/3/17, 1:46 PM - olayinka olawale: Sorry
2/3/17, 1:47 PM - olayinka olawale: Wait, let me get my bible
2/3/17, 1:48 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok
What's the title of this study?
2/3/17, 1:49 PM - Yemi LVCU: 1John 4:1... John here warns of false prophets...
2/3/17, 1:49 PM - Yemi LVCU: Iono yet...it's just along the lines of tongues.
2/3/17, 1:50 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok
2/3/17, 1:51 PM - olayinka olawale: Whenever my mom's imam come to our house and they pray
2/3/17, 1:51 PM - olayinka olawale: He says he believes in Jesus
2/3/17, 1:52 PM - Yemi LVCU: You are in the prayer meeting with them?
But as a *prophet* and says the Holy Spirit is *Mohammed*
2/3/17, 1:53 PM - olayinka olawale: What will we call his own belief?
I've not gotten to ask him if he believesJesus as his personal Lord
2/3/17, 1:54 PM - Yemi LVCU: <Media omitted>
2/3/17, 1:54 PM - olayinka olawale: Sincerely, I dunno but I've had course to believe that theirs is quite different from the ones we hear and see
2/3/17, 1:55 PM - Yemi LVCU: What's the subject here@theirs?
2/3/17, 1:56 PM - olayinka olawale: I said this because he doesn't say Mohammed is the holy ghost
But he still believes in Mohammed too
2/3/17, 1:56 PM - olayinka olawale: I don't get
2/3/17, 1:56 PM - olayinka olawale: But I still know there's something they aren't doing right
2/3/17, 1:57 PM - Yemi LVCU: How long does there meeting last? And you have to be there? He knows you're Christian?
2/3/17, 1:57 PM - olayinka olawale: He knows I'm a christian
2/3/17, 1:57 PM - Yemi LVCU: <Media omitted>
2/3/17, 1:58 PM - olayinka olawale: It's not a meeting per say
It's just whenever they come to pray
2/3/17, 1:58 PM - olayinka olawale: It's like one on one talk with him but my parents are always there
2/3/17, 1:58 PM - Yemi LVCU: You still haven't answered if you're made to be in their meetings...
2/3/17, 1:58 PM - olayinka olawale: I'm there because it's my house
2/3/17, 1:59 PM - olayinka olawale: I'm not forced to join the meeting
2/3/17, 1:59 PM - olayinka olawale: He asks after me at the end of everything 
We greet and he starts like
2/3/17, 1:59 PM - Yemi LVCU: Why are you always there? For the prayer with them or you get summoned after the prayer?
2/3/17, 1:59 PM - Yemi LVCU: Does it hold in your room?
2/3/17, 1:59 PM - olayinka olawale: I know you're a christian
I believe in Jesus too
2/3/17, 1:59 PM - olayinka olawale: My father was a christian
2/3/17, 2:00 PM - olayinka olawale: Just chill and let me write
Will you?
2/3/17, 2:00 PM - Yemi LVCU: Why are you saying this Yinka?
2/3/17, 2:00 PM - Yemi LVCU: I will. Go on.
2/3/17, 2:00 PM - olayinka olawale: I'm telling you what he says na
2/3/17, 2:00 PM - olayinka olawale: Chill o
I'm not turning back o
2/3/17, 2:01 PM - olayinka olawale: What are you thinking?
2/3/17, 2:01 PM - Yemi LVCU: The Imam says his father was a christian too even till death? Or he later converted to Islam.
2/3/17, 2:02 PM - olayinka olawale: He later converted
2/3/17, 2:02 PM - olayinka olawale: Our talks doesn't even last
I just smile at everything and that's it
2/3/17, 2:03 PM - olayinka olawale: But it's not about religion is it?
2/3/17, 2:03 PM - Yemi LVCU: My grandfather too... I regret not meeting him when I finally understood the gospel.
2/3/17, 2:03 PM - Yemi LVCU: What?
2/3/17, 2:04 PM - Yemi LVCU: Network @ home is bae!
2/3/17, 2:04 PM - Yemi LVCU: Super chilling...
2/3/17, 2:04 PM - olayinka olawale: You'd have made his see that he should have been a christian or you'd have changed his belief?
2/3/17, 2:05 PM - Yemi LVCU: If you're done talking, can we take on this?
2/3/17, 2:06 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok, concerning this, I know he couldn't have believed Jesus as his Lord and Saviour and still remain a muslim
2/3/17, 2:07 PM - Yemi LVCU: Let him know Jesus is LORD and find out if he ever had eternal life or would accept Jesus before he lives? Hack his soul as to why he changed. I loved the man! Funny he was the one who started out his elder broter into Anglican church and he was catholic...
2/3/17, 2:07 PM - Yemi LVCU: Yeah sure.
2/3/17, 2:08 PM - Yemi LVCU: Need I go into scriptures or how will you back this up against any opposition or if you had to teach?
2/3/17, 2:09 PM - olayinka olawale: Find out if he had eternal life? How? He was a muslim at that point
2/3/17, 2:09 PM - Yemi LVCU: Maybe you shouldn't be in talks with him at all except if he needs be taught and answered by you!
2/3/17, 2:10 PM - Yemi LVCU: it's not advised at all...we learn instead and greet grounded into the truth we know.
2/3/17, 2:10 PM - olayinka olawale: Brb pls
2/3/17, 2:12 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok
2/3/17, 2:12 PM - Yemi LVCU: If he ever confessed Jesus as LORD and saviour, he received eternal life. The only difference would be that he was going to mosque with it. lol...but really maybe except if it was just a mere profession and mental assent thingy he knew about JESUS...
2/3/17, 2:13 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok, see this thing you just said is what my parents are doing
2/3/17, 2:13 PM - olayinka olawale: I know
2/3/17, 2:13 PM - Yemi LVCU: Explain!
2/3/17, 2:14 PM - Yemi LVCU: The mental profession part?
2/3/17, 2:15 PM - olayinka olawale: My parents, mom especially, believes and confessed Jesus as Lord but she still goes to mosque with it
2/3/17, 2:15 PM - olayinka olawale: She hardly even opens a Quran
2/3/17, 2:15 PM - olayinka olawale: Same with my dad
2/3/17, 2:15 PM - Yemi LVCU: She was from a Christian home?
2/3/17, 2:15 PM - olayinka olawale: But they still go to mosque
2/3/17, 2:16 PM - olayinka olawale: Not really but she was a christian while her parents were muslims
2/3/17, 2:16 PM - Yemi LVCU: The more the reason you have to stay away from all of those!
2/3/17, 2:17 PM - olayinka olawale: My bible is always with my dad
Atimes, he watches KICC on channels and follows scriptures with them
2/3/17, 2:17 PM - Yemi LVCU: For this kinda things, only God can tell...knowing Jesus as lord and savior by head knowledge and no heart commitment  is tantamount to believing not in his work at all. It's just playing kalokalo with the truth of the gospel.
2/3/17, 2:17 PM - olayinka olawale: Stay away from?
2/3/17, 2:18 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok, I get now
2/3/17, 2:18 PM - Yemi LVCU: KICC...sorry what do they teach? They're not many sound preachers out there. I knew one Anglican baba ijo...He was ogboni, alfa, yet attends church....who's his lord?
2/3/17, 2:19 PM - Yemi LVCU: Explain if you get...
2/3/17, 2:19 PM - Yemi LVCU: I still hae a thing to tell you.
2/3/17, 2:19 PM - olayinka olawale: They aren't committed

3/1/17, 1:16 PM - Yemi LVCU: Nothing... It don't matter no more.
3/1/17, 1:19 PM - olayinka olawale: Lol
Don't force what's not
It won't end up good
3/1/17, 1:19 PM - olayinka olawale: And if I'm leading you on with my actions, I'm so sorry
3/1/17, 1:19 PM - olayinka olawale: Have you listened to the vn?
3/1/17, 1:19 PM - Yemi LVCU: I'm forcing a relationship with you? 

Nah I won't... I know!
3/1/17, 1:21 PM - Yemi LVCU: Yeah... I appreciate the effort. Thank you gidi gan!
3/1/17, 1:21 PM - Yemi LVCU: Yeah you tried😅
3/1/17, 1:23 PM - olayinka olawale: Whew! You like to get me wrong
Not a relationship
3/1/17, 1:24 PM - Yemi LVCU: What then?
3/1/17, 1:24 PM - olayinka olawale: The way you always say I'm in love
3/1/17, 1:24 PM - Yemi LVCU: I like?😅😂😅😂 it's becoming an hobby.
3/1/17, 1:27 PM - Yemi LVCU: You got me confused... 

You later said I shudunt force what is not.. Meaning?

What is the thing that's not?

And if I force it, what'll be the end result? A relationship if I'm not wrong. And that we both know cannot happen yeah?

So I'm I really getting you wrong?

Clear the air ma'am.
3/1/17, 1:29 PM - Yemi LVCU: Can you do a reply in a VN? It's fuller that way.
3/1/17, 1:29 PM - olayinka olawale: You keep insinuating I'm in love with you
And i keep telling you I'm not but you just bring it up again
3/1/17, 1:29 PM - olayinka olawale: I don't want you thinking I'm in love with you when I'm not
I just want to make things easier for you and I
3/1/17, 1:29 PM - Yemi LVCU: Wow!
3/1/17, 1:30 PM - Yemi LVCU: Lol
3/1/17, 1:30 PM - olayinka olawale: Yea
Lol
3/1/17, 1:30 PM - Yemi LVCU: Better said. 

You can't be too sure you know!
3/1/17, 1:30 PM - olayinka olawale: Too sure of what?
3/1/17, 1:32 PM - Yemi LVCU: That I'm really bent on the fact that you love me so much so you'd apologize for your actions if they're leading me on.
3/1/17, 1:33 PM - olayinka olawale: So are you saying I proved myself wrong for apologising?
3/1/17, 1:34 PM - Yemi LVCU: Do you get... I've admitted that I do like you, and I've prolly even done a drt so I know what's up.
3/1/17, 1:36 PM - Yemi LVCU: Tryna look for love forcefully from a person even though I think there might be a click is no search I'd get on cos it's not like I've lived in a IDP all my life and to think that if I get it, I'd be getting pity is enuf torture for me and I don't wanna do DAT to myself again.
3/1/17, 1:37 PM - olayinka olawale: What's a drt?
3/1/17, 1:39 PM - Yemi LVCU: Yeah. You were not leading me on. Though that coming from you shows maturity in things surrounding relationships at least. The truth is I for one feel you've only been real with yourself around me. And that's what you've always shown from the day yu intimated me about some very deep things till now. Who would have thought that I'd or you'd get in talks with one like me when our common background is the spirikoko LVCU?
3/1/17, 1:40 PM - Yemi LVCU: Defining relationship talk.
3/1/17, 1:43 PM - Yemi LVCU: So if I have been the one drawing all these shades of you out, I'm sorry. I just gotta

3/1/17, 2:08 PM - olayinka olawale: Abeg pick another one na
3/1/17, 2:08 PM - olayinka olawale: I really can't do that song
3/1/17, 2:15 PM - olayinka olawale: <Media omitted>
3/1/17, 2:20 PM - Yemi LVCU: But how did you manage to out it that Gemini thing I to all these?
3/1/17, 2:22 PM - olayinka olawale: It's just that zodiac rubbish
I believe it to an extent though
3/1/17, 2:37 PM - Yemi LVCU: 😏😏😏😏
3/1/17, 2:37 PM - Yemi LVCU: Let's face issues when we need or have to... Even if we'd fix a later time for them.
3/1/17, 2:37 PM - Yemi LVCU: But how did you manage to put Gemini here? You actually operate with all these zodiac signs and all?
3/1/17, 2:38 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok
3/1/17, 2:38 PM - olayinka olawale: Gemini means twin
3/1/17, 2:38 PM - olayinka olawale: ♊ that's the sign
3/1/17, 2:39 PM - olayinka olawale: Two things acting in one
3/1/17, 2:40 PM - olayinka olawale: So one side of me might be telling you I'm in love with you whereas the other side isn't in agreement.
So I thought that was what was happening
3/1/17, 2:40 PM - olayinka olawale: It's a long thing
All these zodiac things
3/1/17, 2:41 PM - olayinka olawale: Do you believe in telepathy?
3/1/17, 4:00 PM - Yemi LVCU: OK... Lionel Richie's "I call it love"
3/1/17, 4:01 PM - Yemi LVCU: Hope you don't mind that we're not doing hillsong... Or sing Hillsong's "sinking deep"
3/1/17, 5:04 PM - Yemi LVCU: It happened to me once every year for three years stretch.

3/1/17, 9:04 PM - olayinka olawale: A way of communicating thoughts directly from one person's mind to another person's mind without using words or signals
3/1/17, 9:08 PM - Yemi LVCU: If there wasn't a strong mind communication, how would I have known?
3/1/17, 9:08 PM - Yemi LVCU: Except if you're noe defining telepathy as some art oooo!

Let's forget about it already
3/3/17, 8:15 AM - olayinka olawale: Deal
If you see any song you think I can do, just send it
3/3/17, 8:16 AM - Yemi LVCU: Thanks... But before then, I was gonna ask us to discuss n look into some things..
3/3/17, 8:19 AM - Yemi LVCU: Start with some of your own choices... I might give you hard ones.
3/3/17, 8:41 AM - Yemi LVCU: <Media omitted>
3/3/17, 8:46 AM - olayinka olawale: Ok
3/3/17, 8:46 AM - olayinka olawale: Ok, let's start
3/3/17, 8:46 AM - olayinka olawale: I might be going and coming though
3/3/17, 8:47 AM - Yemi LVCU: Are you sure?
3/3/17, 8:47 AM - Yemi LVCU: We'd best do VN
3/3/17, 8:49 AM - Yemi LVCU: Its about *sensitivity*
3/3/17, 8:49 AM - Yemi LVCU: From the day you said I hold on to things and all. 

What dyu know about sensitivity or me being sensitive?
3/3/17, 8:51 AM - olayinka olawale: Ok
There's a difference between not letting go and sensitivity
3/3/17, 8:51 AM - Yemi LVCU: Would you rather have an insensitive person or you'd have a sensitive person that knows how best to use it. 

For me I see n consider my sensitivity as an intelligence. 

Do VN I like your voice!🤐😬
3/3/17, 8:52 AM - olayinka olawale: Sensitivity
Quick to react/ upset
And I never said you're sensitive
3/3/17, 8:52 AM - olayinka olawale: Let me use vn then
3/3/17, 8:53 AM - Yemi LVCU: You never said so...yeah... I'm asking now.
3/3/17, 8:53 AM - Yemi LVCU: Because I like it...oshey!
3/3/17, 8:52 AM - olayinka olawale: <Media omitted>
3/3/17, 8:55 AM - Yemi LVCU: The other issue is on this whole zodiac thing. 

How long have you applied or believed it? Tbh, did you ever use it to consider your compatibility with your bf then?
3/3/17, 8:56 AM - Yemi LVCU: There's more.
3/3/17, 8:57 AM - olayinka olawale: If I'm everything, one thing I'm not is to be so stupid and gullible to the extent of using zodiac sign to define a relationship
3/3/17, 8:58 AM - olayinka olawale: Zodiac whatever is just for the fun of it to me
3/3/17, 8:58 AM - olayinka olawale: It doesn't determine how my life goes
3/3/17, 8:58 AM - olayinka olawale: What's tbh?
3/3/17, 9:01 AM - Yemi LVCU: To be honest.
3/3/17, 9:01 AM - Yemi LVCU: We can't fight babe. I'm only getting to know you girl.
3/3/17, 9:02 AM - Yemi LVCU: Just talk... Without any fears, don't walk on egg shells with me. 

Actually, all those things you said are proofs of a sensitive person and I know I am. And its not a sickness.🤣
3/3/17, 9:02 AM - olayinka olawale: ???
3/3/17, 9:04 AM - Yemi LVCU: The day we first had a quarrel and I said I'd cut the call, you actually said things like..."iono when you'd get angry or not and I try to check if you'd like it or not when I say or type sth before I type..."
3/3/17, 9:05 AM - olayinka olawale: Yea, I did
3/3/17, 9:05 AM - olayinka olawale: We've not fought then
I didn't know what would trip you off
I didn't want to be the one at fault on one hand too
3/3/17, 9:08 AM - Yemi LVCU: It's not safe living in fears with a person... What I appreciate is the fact that you said all those when we had not fought or anything..
3/3/17, 9:10 AM - olayinka olawale: Ok
3/3/17, 9:10 AM - olayinka olawale: I won't call it fear
You can't kill me
3/3/17, 9:10 AM - olayinka olawale: I was just too cautious
3/3/17, 9:11 AM - Yemi LVCU: So please talk. 

I've never been this real or close to no geh ever! And I'm learning the best here. Knowing d defined "status" of this *....ship*
3/3/17, 9:12 AM - Yemi LVCU: Walking on egg shells...fears all the same not like you're afraid of me jor!
3/3/17, 9:12 AM - olayinka olawale: I've heard
3/3/17, 9:13 AM - Yemi LVCU: Be forming tough geh... "You can't kill me..." Yan yan yan yan!
3/3/17, 9:14 AM - Yemi LVCU: So to another matter, I'd like to respect your view on this, you may or may not answer but its fine.
3/3/17, 9:14 AM - Yemi LVCU: About sex and all... It's true it opens up for more yeah? How was the case with you?
3/3/17, 9:16 AM - Yemi LVCU: And since then, what has it been as related to such issues? You still feel the urge? I feel awkward too asking so it's fine if you decline, but I'd like to know and in clarity so ion have to ask further...
3/3/17, 9:16 AM - Yemi LVCU: Sorry if it's somehow... You can decline I said.
3/3/17, 9:16 AM - olayinka olawale: Brb
3/3/17, 9:16 AM - olayinka olawale: I'm ironing
3/3/17, 9:18 AM - Yemi LVCU: Ok...
3/3/17, 9:21 AM - olayinka olawale: <Media omitted>
3/3/17, 9:22 AM - olayinka olawale: Open up for more as in?
3/3/17, 9:23 AM - olayinka olawale: <Media omitted>
3/3/17, 9:24 AM - olayinka olawale: As in brings about wanting more?
3/3/17, 9:25 AM - Yemi LVCU: If a person has sex once or maybe the first time, they'll wanna do so more... You get? It unlocks more in the sense of sexual and romantic things... Physical I mean. And a relationship already opens up the avenue for such and makes room for more advances in that.
3/3/17, 9:24 AM - olayinka olawale: <Media omitted>
3/3/17, 9:26 AM - Yemi LVCU: What's this? The ringworm?
3/3/17, 9:27 AM - olayinka olawale: Yea
3/3/17, 9:31 AM - Yemi LVCU: More advances going down  to telephone scatalogia, audio n visual...
3/3/17, 9:31 AM - Yemi LVCU: It's not gone yet?
3/3/17, 9:31 AM - Yemi LVCU: Your left arm yeah?
3/3/17, 9:31 AM - Yemi LVCU: Has it reduced at all in other parts?
3/3/17, 9:32 AM - olayinka olawale: It didn't reduce
3/3/17, 9:32 AM - olayinka olawale: I have it on other parts now sef majorly my stomach but I hope it'd go
3/3/17, 9:33 AM - olayinka olawale: They said it's contagious and I think i contacted it from one of my cousins that stayed with me last session
3/3/17, 9:33 AM - olayinka olawale: She had a big one on her back and we sleep in bed together
3/3/17, 9:33 AM - olayinka olawale: Slept* for a whole session
3/3/17, 9:34 AM - olayinka olawale: I don't get
Abeg reduce the English
3/3/17, 9:39 AM - Yemi LVCU: So you've gotten a hype bout it like you gfs telling you about it or what? Your gfs all knew you were a virgin all through yeah? What was it like? What were you expecting that you didn't meet? 🤣🤣🤣

You've only had it once niyen yeah?

You don't feel the urge again or not as much as before it happened?
3/3/17, 9:40 AM - Yemi LVCU: Telephone scatalogia is like having convoys, sharing pix and all to stimulate each other sexually... Sometimes, when it's audio, the other party may not be aware that one of them has that intention of getting sexual arousal from there... Example is phone sex, exchanging nudies, talking erotically about sexual organs or parts, making sexual sounds or noises, sexual jokes and all, sharing pornographic pix or videos of people or selves( the people involved)
3/3/17, 9:41 AM - Yemi LVCU: And do you or have you ever gotten such advances too from people and all...
3/3/17, 9:42 AM - olayinka olawale: No, I haven't but I've seen someone do it to my roomie
3/3/17, 9:42 AM - olayinka olawale: He sent her his penis and she showed us 
The funniest thing the person is a *brother*
3/3/17, 9:42 AM - Yemi LVCU: She told you or you found out? Twas audio?
3/3/17, 9:42 AM - olayinka olawale: Brb
3/3/17, 9:43 AM - Yemi LVCU: Jesus!
3/3/17, 9:45 AM - olayinka olawale: Yea
3/3/17, 9:45 AM - Yemi LVCU: Sad! Things happen, I've seen, I've heard.
3/3/17, 9:46 AM - olayinka olawale: Even before it happened, I wasn't much of the feeler
It happening made it all worse
3/3/17, 9:47 AM - olayinka olawale: I have just few friends in which most of them are virgins
3/3/17, 9:47 AM - Yemi LVCU: So all of you too were looking! Spoilt gehs...

Were they in the same fellowship?
3/3/17, 9:47 AM - olayinka olawale: We hardly even spoke about sex
3/3/17, 9:48 AM - Yemi LVCU: Awwww! 

What's a feeler?
3/3/17, 9:48 AM - Yemi LVCU: Not out of pretense sha?
3/3/17, 9:48 AM - olayinka olawale: How won't I look na
She showed me... lol
I guess we just wanted to see
Yea, same church
3/3/17, 9:49 AM - olayinka olawale: Not at all
Most of them didn't know wassup
3/3/17, 9:50 AM - Yemi LVCU: How? They're kids? Abi them dey pretend?
3/3/17, 9:50 AM - Yemi LVCU: This campus abi?
3/3/17, 9:50 AM - olayinka olawale: As regards what I was expecting
I really didn't know what I was expecting but I think i was expecting it to be all pleasing and sweet like I've read online and in books 
But it was worst
And I guess I wasn't expecting it to happen
And the pain again
3/3/17, 9:50 AM - Yemi LVCU: You gehs get real gists oooh!
3/3/17, 9:51 AM - olayinka olawale: They aren't
They are older than I am
And it wasn't pretense
We talked about sex as sacred
We all wanted to keep it for marriage
3/3/17, 9:52 AM - Yemi LVCU: So it's true virgins get pains! Oh! The tear.
3/3/17, 9:52 AM - olayinka olawale: It's sha unilag
I don't want to mention the name of the guy but he's very popular
You might just be friends with him
3/3/17, 9:53 AM - Yemi LVCU: Who? Talk jor..
3/3/17, 9:53 AM - olayinka olawale: Funny thing is there might be no tear as at that time, it might just be expansion
The hymen might have been broken earlier even without sex
3/3/17, 9:54 AM - Yemi LVCU: How?
3/3/17, 9:54 AM - Yemi LVCU: Meaning you had no tear, no bleeding?
3/3/17, 9:55 AM - olayinka olawale: The hymen is fragile
Ordinary jumping gutter or riding bicycle as kids can break it
3/3/17, 9:55 AM - olayinka olawale: I did
It was just very small

3/16/17, 7:37 PM - Yemi LVCU: We don't really talk much even tho we do, I'm not sure I'm in her inner circle. I'm the not so serious guy, my playfulness is what many see. Ion know. But we still talk sha...
3/16/17, 7:37 PM - Yemi LVCU: Examples? I've not been keeping tracks...
3/16/17, 7:43 PM - olayinka olawale: You're not sure you're in her inner circle but she's in yours?
3/16/17, 7:43 PM - Yemi LVCU: But being a purpose driven lady, I cherish her really.
3/16/17, 7:46 PM - Yemi LVCU: Somewhere close. 

For me, for the opposite sex, she'd def rate maybe first.

We're not as we seem on the outside or surface really. 

I didn't serve with em a second time yiu know. So only those who didn't let that mean a barrier in really being friends r in that circle of mine. Few guys. And I recycle.
3/16/17, 7:47 PM - olayinka olawale: I sense somethings in this
3/16/17, 7:48 PM - olayinka olawale: But let sleeping dogs lay
3/16/17, 7:48 PM - olayinka olawale: Emmm

3/16/17, 7:52 PM - olayinka olawale: Apart from Seni
3/16/17, 7:53 PM - Yemi LVCU: I'm still in touch. Infact many thought I was in their set.
3/16/17, 7:54 PM - olayinka olawale: Expatiate from the I didn't serve to I recycle
3/16/17, 7:54 PM - Yemi LVCU: That's not necessarily all... Maybe all I can remember... Not much to add. I cherish all brethren too. It's not based only on spirikoko levels I choose
3/16/17, 7:56 PM - Yemi LVCU: I got close to her cos we served once. 

We clicked cos we prolly in the league of leaders/MoGs in the house. When I didn't serve again, I was a unit member under her giving my best, but her circle kinda had its circumference touching mine.
3/16/17, 7:57 PM - Yemi LVCU: Serving for that second time when I didn't serve, I remained with the elders, was kinda part of the ECC
3/16/17, 7:57 PM - olayinka olawale: You weren't referring to just her here
3/16/17, 7:58 PM - Yemi LVCU: Then, we didn't really have a beyond the unit member/head relationship. I make sure to keep in touch and get a reciprocating too... But mine is cos I have a problem not forgetting people and always having them in my tots
3/16/17, 7:58 PM - Yemi LVCU: Here! Not just her.
3/16/17, 8:00 PM - Yemi LVCU: That circle is purpose defined. I get shaped in it. I'm the work in progress in own circle. She's very relevant too. But by relationship stays outside
3/16/17, 8:00 PM - olayinka olawale: Okay, I gelt
3/16/17, 8:01 PM - Yemi LVCU: What were you thinking?
3/16/17, 8:01 PM - Yemi LVCU: Not cos I make it stay outside ooo, it's just our natural.
3/16/17, 8:02 PM - olayinka olawale: I was thinking you felt like she kind of jilted you when she served the second time
But I get you now
3/16/17, 8:02 PM - Yemi LVCU: Nah! Never! I declined service. From the letter.
3/16/17, 8:02 PM - Yemi LVCU: I wanted to but had to choose not too.
3/16/17, 8:03 PM - olayinka olawale: Why?
3/16/17, 8:04 PM - Yemi LVCU: Was at my lowest at the time. Too much that I couldn't just bring on into service. Worries and all.
3/16/17, 8:06 PM - olayinka olawale: Okay

3/17/17, 9:41 PM - Yemi LVCU: <Media omitted>
3/18/17, 9:02 AM - olayinka olawale: Good morning
3/18/17, 9:02 AM - olayinka olawale: Nice one but you can do better

3/18/17, 9:13 AM - Yemi LVCU: When will you have enuf ba3 nau!?
3/18/17, 9:13 AM - Yemi LVCU: Good morning
3/18/17, 11:22 AM - Yemi LVCU: To my single friends and acquaintances,
I write:

I  have a few things to say. Some of which you may know already but would nevertheless be refreshing.

It's normal for the average young man or woman to have usual expectations of life. Career. Post-graduate studies. Marriage. And so on. 

It's heightened when the general season for making these decisions arrives. E.g Approaching final year, Graduation etc

Apart from inner wrestling there's the external pressure that mounts. From family friends and well wishers. It comes in form of jokes, advice,  prayer, all sorts

You are reminded everyday. I know. 
Pre-wedding photo shoots,  relationships every where. 

There are days when you reassure yourself that you are alone and not lonely. I know. 
And then you wonder what it would be like to be in a relationship. Or to be in one again 

Well it's perfectly natural to desire to be in a relationship 
It's also normal to have ideal and practical specifications. 

But then, we must be careful not to make so much out of this stage that it begins to feel like the peak of all achievements, like most are prone to do with marriage. 
It is lovely, beautiful and different, still it doesn't solve life's problems. Life goes on. Your goals, pursuits, achievements and challenges remain. 

Some of the internal pressure can be sorted by toning down on certain stimulants. They can make you unnecessarily vulnerable.
There are some kinds of songs, movies etc that don't exactly help you. 
Especially those tons of romance novels some ladies love to devour. 
You may want to divert all that energy and passion to more productive things that would help you achieve some of your set goals. 

Who is ready to be in a relationship?
Someone who has a firm grasp of what God will have them do with their lives and is working on it. 
Then such a person can more easily identify a suitable partner to journey through life.

By now you know it's an unforgivable cliche to say brazenly that you are waiting for the right man or woman. 
Why?  Because you should be doing more than just waiting. 

Some of the things you could be doing apart from/in addition to dreaming or writing letters to future bae

1. First have an idea of what you expect in relationship and marriage and pointers to look out for. Pen them down if necessary
In their order of priority. 
For example: 
Spiritual(Saved, doing the work of the ministry etc) ---Character/Personality requirements----Physical preferences 
You should know what really matters

2. Set goals and plans for yourself in every area of your life. Spiritual. Career. Ministry. Personal Development. 
Work on them steadily. Review your performance from time to time. Grow. Get going. Keep advancing. 

3. Funny as it sounds many folks know next to nothing about relationships. When to? How to? Why to? What to do? Please get to know. By all means. A good place to go is books by Christian authors and messages from seasoned teachers of the word. 
Some people are in desperate need of an education. 
You cannot, must not be clueless
You would avoid many pitfalls in front. You can thank me later. 

4. Build worthy friendships and supernatural relationships. You need an amazing network.(More in worth than numbers) I could say this a million times. 
Hint: Most relationships would be sourced from here. 
They would also be your go-to people(for accountability ) when you are ready to make that big step.

5. Trust God. Because he directs our paths, leads our hearts and orchestrates our lives. 
How beautiful! How comforting! 
Bask in his love and in the fulfillment only he brings. 
Let go of past mistakes. Learn and move on. 
Banish the days of uncertainty and concern, usher in days of confidence and trust in God's plan for you. 

Refuse to settle for less.
Repel the desperation. 
Reject the pressure.
Refute the confusion.
Proceed clearly and confidently.

My friends and acquaintances that are in relationships; I have plenty to tell you but you cannot bear them now. 
Till next year or you can speed it up by doing the needful. 

Caveat
This is by no means exhaustive 
I'm no agony aunt, nor expert, nor relationship adviser. 
Be nice in the comment box. Or else... 

                          *******
It's my first writing for the year. An unusual topic for me at that. 
Certain people keep me on my toes. To show appreciation is noble.

One of such is my sister and friend 
Oluwatobi Elegbeleye
She makes me know that she looks forward to my writings. 
I remember those nights, our  fingers-crossed moments, countless times of encouragement and our once-in-a-while chats 
This is for you. 

Till I come again 
Stay in charge

4/5/17, 7:23 AM - Yemi LVCU: Bye
4/5/17, 7:24 AM - olayinka olawale: Don't go o
4/5/17, 7:24 AM - Yemi LVCU: What's left to say?
4/5/17, 7:26 AM - olayinka olawale: Doing something "in time" means doing it before a deadline, or doing it before it becomes unavailable
4/5/17, 7:27 AM - Yemi LVCU: Mo ma daraan ooooo.
4/5/17, 7:27 AM - olayinka olawale: On top?
4/5/17, 7:27 AM - Yemi LVCU: On time nko baayi?
4/5/17, 7:29 AM - olayinka olawale: Let me give you a clear example
4/5/17, 7:29 AM - olayinka olawale: So, something like: "My appointment was a 8, but I arrived at 7:55, in time to wash my face before the meeting". "On time" means that you arrived when you were supposed to: "My meeting was at 8, but I wasn't exactly on time, I was 5 minutes early". ... However, in time means with enough time to spare
4/5/17, 7:29 AM - Yemi LVCU: First search from google?
4/5/17, 7:30 AM - Yemi LVCU: That'd prove me right not you!

I applied the brake before the car hit the sign board na
4/5/17, 7:31 AM - olayinka olawale: I didn't hit the board before applying
4/5/17, 7:31 AM - olayinka olawale: Explain
4/5/17, 7:31 AM - Yemi LVCU: Yeah when you were supposed to! "On time"
4/5/17, 7:32 AM - olayinka olawale: Lol
Let me tell you why I used in time before my phone goes off
4/5/17, 7:33 AM - olayinka olawale: Let's assume me hitting the sign board is the time, x
4/5/17, 7:33 AM - Yemi LVCU: You hit it and had enough time to spare
4/5/17, 7:33 AM - Yemi LVCU: At time x-whatever
4/5/17, 7:34 AM - Yemi LVCU: You applied the brakes just in time.
4/5/17, 7:34 AM - Yemi LVCU: Bye... Nau?
4/5/17, 7:35 AM - olayinka olawale: So there's a target to hit, x
So I didn't hit the sign board which is x when I was supposed to 
I still had seconds to hit the sign board
So in that seconds I had after applying my brake, I could still get down from the car to see that it didn't touch the sign board
4/5/17, 7:36 AM - olayinka olawale: I hope that was more explicit when compared to 👆🏼
4/5/17, 7:37 AM - olayinka olawale: I hope I haven't dabaru anything

4/18/17, 9:00 PM - Yemi LVCU: Many graduates are mathematicians but still gets confuse at times.This looks easy but it is not because everyone will arrive at a different answer…
A lady bought goods worth ₦200 and paid the
shopkeeper with a ₦1000 Note.
The Shopkeeper had no change on him so he
went to another Shopkeeper John his neighbour and collected ₦1000 change in ₦200 denominations, with which he settled the lady and she left.
A little while later, John came back angrily after
he discovered the ₦1000 note he was given by the shopkeeper was fake, and demanded a replacement.
To avoid trouble, the shopkeeper had to give John another ₦1000 and destroyed the counterfeit which had no real value.
So Question for the geniuses…
How much has the Shopkeeper lost in total?
A. ₦1200
B. ₦2000
C. ₦1000
D. ₦1800
E. ₦2200

Was hanging out alone with noone, I was helpless
Didn't care about it so much
All I had with me was a dream...
And it was a beautiful...
Now I realise
You were standing there
Even when I thought that noone was around
Now I understand 
You came as a dream mm
A dream that's left my life so beautiful
Kauna Allah

JOHN LEGEND LYRICS
Play the John Legend Quiz
"Ordinary People"

[Verse 1]

Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

[Bridge]

I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Chorus]

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

[Verse 2]

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way

[Bridge]

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

[Chorus]

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

4/30/17, 5:52 PM - olayinka olawale: Really?

4/30/17, 5:56 PM - Yemi LVCU: I'm serious about this but what does it matter?
4/30/17, 5:57 PM - olayinka olawale: Because that's your thought doesn't mean it's right
4/30/17, 5:57 PM - olayinka olawale: But what does it matter?
4/30/17, 5:58 PM - Yemi LVCU: Tell me otherwise then!
4/30/17, 6:00 PM - olayinka olawale: I'm nothing saying more

4/30/17, 6:01 PM - olayinka olawale: I'm not saying nothing more

4/30/17, 6:01 PM - Yemi LVCU: Hey come back here you!
4/30/17, 6:05 PM - olayinka olawale: Thank you, I'm not coming
4/30/17, 6:06 PM - Yemi LVCU: You we have stuff to talk about and you know it.

But you want talk to me until I chat u up that's unfair. 

Plus it makes me think many other things so why not just avoid that all of the time?

Right now I'm on my way back home but I took the available chance to reach out and then from there we'd talk about what we left off last night. 

Put your sef in my shoes and see how it feels Yinka. 

And it's not like I couldn't have noticed and then take my silent measure to avoid how that makes me feel.
4/30/17, 6:10 PM - olayinka olawale: You couldn't have taken Amy silent measure.
You that I know wouldn't
4/30/17, 6:11 PM - olayinka olawale: Let's talk the talk
4/30/17, 6:13 PM - Yemi LVCU: This speak volumes still. Smh.
4/30/17, 6:13 PM - Yemi LVCU: I'd be home in 30 mins. Iono when I'd be up for yanz.
4/30/17, 6:14 PM - Yemi LVCU: That's why yiu had the assurance that I'd chat you up when I want. OK.
4/30/17, 6:22 PM - olayinka olawale: I don't have the strength for small fights
4/30/17, 6:22 PM - olayinka olawale: Just cool off and let's talk when you're ready
5/1/17, 7:46 AM - Yemi LVCU: Good morning
5/1/17, 8:23 AM - Yemi LVCU: Happy new month to you. I wish you all the best this month.
5/1/17, 1:53 PM - olayinka olawale: Thank you
5/1/17, 1:53 PM - olayinka olawale: Same to you
5/1/17, 1:53 PM - olayinka olawale: Wassup?
5/1/17, 1:54 PM - Yemi LVCU: Hey...
5/1/17, 1:55 PM - Yemi LVCU: Sorry for yesterday.
5/1/17, 1:55 PM - Yemi LVCU: I'm good
5/1/17, 1:55 PM - Yemi LVCU: How's you in this weather?
5/1/17, 1:57 PM - Yemi LVCU: You up for yanz?
5/1/17, 1:57 PM - olayinka olawale: Yea
5/1/17, 1:58 PM - Yemi LVCU: Yeah. You were talking about church and all an I think I was gonna chip in something yh?
5/1/17, 1:59 PM - Yemi LVCU: Did it rain over @ urs?
5/1/17, 1:59 PM - olayinka olawale: It did
5/1/17, 2:00 PM - Yemi LVCU: Cool.
5/1/17, 2:00 PM - olayinka olawale: Yea you were
5/1/17, 2:00 PM - Yemi LVCU: So I asked how's u in this weather.
5/1/17, 2:01 PM - Yemi LVCU: Welcome to our month. I cannot say this @you on the GRP. Peeps wee start raising prying eyes.. 🤣
5/1/17, 2:01 PM - Yemi LVCU: So we can go on to talk proper yeah?
5/1/17, 2:02 PM - Yemi LVCU: But as usual, it'd still be question driven you'd pardon me.
5/1/17, 2:02 PM - olayinka olawale: I'm good
5/1/17, 2:03 PM - olayinka olawale: Can we start the talk already?
5/1/17, 2:03 PM - Yemi LVCU: And you don't mind VN do you?
5/1/17, 2:03 PM - olayinka olawale: Can there not be questions for once?
5/1/17, 2:03 PM - Yemi LVCU: Yeah ma!🤣🤣🤣
5/1/17, 2:04 PM - Yemi LVCU: Wow! That'd be some work there for me...
5/1/17, 2:04 PM - olayinka olawale: Why will it be work?
5/1/17, 2:06 PM - Yemi LVCU: Cos, how will I know what and what to address? If I just talk without a knowledge of what I am supposed to be hitting, you sure wouldn't be fine with me "schooling you." Would you?
5/1/17, 2:10 PM - olayinka olawale: On the other hand, your questions are always many
5/1/17, 2:10 PM - olayinka olawale: Let's just talk wetin we Wan talk
5/1/17, 2:14 PM - Yemi LVCU: Pele.
5/1/17, 2:14 PM - Yemi LVCU: OK.
5/1/17, 2:16 PM - Yemi LVCU: So what would you expect a church basically to deliver, let's say using what LVCU gave us as template?
5/1/17, 2:20 PM - olayinka olawale: I'd answer it based on how you asked the other day. Major thing
Accommodating people
5/1/17, 2:21 PM - Yemi LVCU: That's pregnant can you expatiate @accomodating people?
5/1/17, 2:21 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok
5/1/17, 2:22 PM - Yemi LVCU: And why don't you wanna answer it based on "what LVCU gave us as template"?
5/1/17, 2:24 PM - olayinka olawale: Atleast build a little relationship with people
Since I got to this church, I can say only 1 person knows my name. All they want is me attending their youth meetings and none of them even knows me
5/1/17, 2:24 PM - olayinka olawale: If they see me, fine
If they don't, fine
5/1/17, 2:25 PM - olayinka olawale: I just did without having to mention LVCU
5/1/17, 2:25 PM - Yemi LVCU: OK...that's what you meant by accommodating people
5/1/17, 2:26 PM - olayinka olawale: Yea
5/1/17, 2:27 PM - Yemi LVCU: Well there's more to the kinda training LVCU gave than the accommodating tho it was very practiced.
5/1/17, 2:28 PM - olayinka olawale: But that's like the first step
5/1/17, 2:28 PM - olayinka olawale: If you don't accommodate someone, would you be able to check on how the person is doing or growing?
5/1/17, 2:29 PM - Yemi LVCU: And you know, I was asking about that because you had mentioned sth about you not getting what you're supposed to be getting there or sth like that, when we talked on call.
5/1/17, 2:29 PM - Yemi LVCU: I didn't invalidate the point you made.
5/1/17, 2:29 PM - olayinka olawale: Ok
5/1/17, 2:29 PM - olayinka olawale: It's all part of it
5/1/17, 2:30 PM - olayinka olawale: Basically, church starts by 8, ends by 12 or 1 atimes
5/1/17, 2:30 PM - olayinka olawale: 5 hours, it's kind of too much
5/1/17, 2:30 PM - Yemi LVCU: OK..
5/1/17, 2:30 PM - olayinka olawale: They said Sunday school is 8-10... I hardly even go for the Sunday school
5/1/17, 2:31 PM - Yemi LVCU: 😅
5/1/17, 2:31 PM - olayinka olawale: Then when it starts by 10, we sing and pray and they do other things they have to do
5/1/17, 2:31 PM - olayinka olawale: Atimes, no Sermon
5/1/17, 2:32 PM - olayinka olawale: Most times, they just give us steps on what was thought in sunday school as sermon
5/1/17, 2:34 PM - Yemi LVCU: Gbam.
5/1/17, 2:34 PM - olayinka olawale: 😏😏😏😏
5/1/17, 2:35 PM - Yemi LVCU: Lol
5/1/17, 2:36 PM - Yemi LVCU: OK errrm, this is what I was expecting earlier when I asked. Or should I say this is what I felt you'd be talking about when you said you weren't getting what you were supposed to be getting.
5/1/17, 2:37 PM - Yemi LVCU: So you only attend Sunday service yeah? 
And the "active" youth arm is active at what and what?
5/1/17, 2:37 PM - olayinka olawale: Yea, just sundays
5/1/17, 2:38 PM - olayinka olawale: Active at having meetings and doing their part whenever there's anything to be done
5/1/17, 2:38 PM - Yemi LVCU: Enh, what's the. Content of their meetings?
5/1/17, 2:42 PM - olayinka olawale: Majorly on future events

5/1/17, 2:46 PM - olayinka olawale: No
