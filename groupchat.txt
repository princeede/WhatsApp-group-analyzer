_EPISODE 15_

The tour was wonderful and mind-blowing. Luciana was so pleased with the beauty of the house. The flowers at the back of the house really thrilled Luciana, and she walked about, touching them with smiles on her face. Raymond deduced that she must love flowers a lot.
“I love sunflower; I never get tired of looking at it” Luciana gazed lovingly at the yellow flower heads which stood tall and spread all over. She touched them with her fingers, loving its feel.
Raymond smiled. That flower was actually his mum’s favourite flower and she had done all she could to have a sizeable amount for their compound. He had watered it for a long time because he also developed a love for flowers. Who would not when you have a mother that can spend her last penny on flowers? He had his mum purchase the flowers for him in order to beautify his house. Tinuke had also played her part in getting some flowers. He remembered his mum and the plane crash flashed back. He froze and turned instantly, but not before Lucy saw the pained expression on his face.
“I am sorry sir, did I say something wrong?” she was worried and a bit scared.
“Uhn? No… No. come on, let me show you the other parts of the house” Raymond said hastily, trying to destroy the image which had become the wallpaper of his mind. Lucy strolled behind like a gentle puppy, not uttering a word. She knew without a doubt that there was something haunting Raymond. That expression was similar to the one she had seen on their way from the hospital, but more intense.
They went round the house with Raymond doing all the talking. It seemed like he was trying to talk his way out of the pain he was hiding and Luciana just kept murmuring ‘hmmms’ and nodding at intervals. She was trying to see if there was a little opening which she could use to probe him, but she got none; Ray successfully filled every silence.
There were two very small buildings at the far end of the spacious compound, behind the main building which looked like boys’ quarters. Ray did not say anything about them and she was curious. She wondered what the buildings were for or who lived there; although she doubted if anyone lived there.
“I love the house; you have great taste” she said with a smile on her face.
“I love your dimples” Ray said without thinking. She smiled shyly, looking at her feet. Raymond was astonished that she was so shy when she clearly was exceedingly blessed with beauty. She behaved as if she had no idea of the effects she had on men. If it had been tinuke, she would have been flirting endlessly now.
“Erm… why don’t we go and get something to eat? Maybe in a nearby eatery?” he asked with raised eyebrows. He really wished he already got a maid.
She looked hesitant. “Or, I could prepare something?” she asked back, trying not to seem too forward. She hadn’t even spent 24 hours in the house yet.
“No. you are my guest and I should not put you through the stress, besides, you need your strength. You just came back from the hospital and the first thing you need is rest”
“Oh, c’mon now. I cant rest forever. I have been lying on that hospital bed for God only knows how long, I need some form of exercise. It is not right for you to waste money at the eatery when a woman is in the house” she looked straight at him until Raymond started wondering if she was actually shy or she had been pretending. She looked so bold.
He shook his head. “I am sorry. It is not always like this. Bose just left and due to my lack of interest when it comes to kitchen matters, I was not able to learn any cooking skills” he actually looked ashamed of himself.
“Thought you said your fiancee’s name is Tinuke” Luciana questioned slightly, feeling as if she was going beyond her boundaries.
“Oh… erm… Bose is my maid… I mean… was” he stammered.
“Oh…” was all she could say. She thought for some time then nodded slightly. “well, how about we make the dinner a little bit fun. I would cook and also tutor you along the way. Do you at least know how to boil water?” Lucy asked with a feigned worry expression on her face.
He laughed. “C’mon, I am not that pathetic. I can prepare the best tea and coffee; you need to taste it. I can also fry eggs; as long as the salt does not go overboard” he had a puppy face and Lucy laughed her heart out. She remembered Deolu who could prepare any meal. Sometimes, Lucy felt like an amateur whenever Deolu talked about his kitchen skills.
Raymond was torn between allowing Lucy to cook and insisting she does not. He had missed home-made foods so much. Ever since Bose left and Tinuke stepped into the house, he had stopped eating at home and had become a regular customer at the eatery. Having a good meal would really be welcome but he was worried about her health.
“I still insist that you are not strong enough”.
“Nah… cooking can never bother Luciana Jones. If you think you can escape a thorough lesson in cooking by persuading me out of this, then you have failed. You would become a certified Mr Chef in no time”. Her wide smile revealed the most perfect set of teeth he had ever seen as she placed her hands on her hips like a primary school teacher.
He laughed heartily as he raised his hands in surrender. Luciana had a cool sense of humour and he was happy about it. His life had been full of sadness that he had practically lost his sense of humour and ability to laugh in the process. Maybe Luciana was the cure to that ailment.
**********
**********
Everything had gone so well. Luciana had never had that much fun in her life. She always enjoyed cooking but not that much. They did not behave as if they had just met but did lot of things together. She made fun of him a lot when he asked a totally unbelievable question about ingredients and they both laughed it off. It was so much fun that she did not know when the food was ready.
They had talked and laughed throughout the meal, not even observing table manners. Raymond had praised her endlessly about how good she was and how delicious the meal was. Raymond was sure that he would enjoy his sleep after eating such a delicious meal of Poundo yam and egusi soup with enough stock fish and meat. Raymond pleaded with Lucy to go and have some rest while he took care of the plates but she refused. Lucy washed the plates while he dried them and arranged them in the rack.
Lucy retired to the guests’ room some minutes later. Her strength had drained and she felt sleepy. She was surprised that she had actually enjoyed herself that much. If kitchen work could always be that interesting, she would love to sleep and wake there. She remembered her family and friends and all the happiness she had felt a while ago evaporated. She had successfully pushed that thought to the back of her mind throughout but now that she was alone, she could not hide her grief. She was there, laughing, while her loved ones are running from pillar to post, looking for her. Tears of despair rolled down her cheeks as she closed her eyes. She had no right to smile when her loved ones were obviously going through hell. All the same, she could not put them in danger by showing up there because she would not be able to bear it if anything happened to anyone. She needed a way out. Probably, one call might not be too risky? She wondered. Could she take the risk?
**********
**********
Raymond came out of the bathroom after a cold bath and jumped on the bed. He raked his wet hair with his fingers as he became lost in thoughts. Being in the kitchen with Lucy was an experience he surely would live to remember. The kitchen had been filled with so much laughter and merriment. He tried to remember the last time his house had been filled with so much life but could not recall any.
He felt deep gratitude towards her. She had managed to put a smile on his face after a very long time of continuous sadness and he really wanted to make her smile genuinely. He knew that she must be going through a lot, even if she tried to cover it. He had promised not to interfere but he really wanted to help her sort out this mess she was in. ‘My numerous contacts should be good for something’, he thought.
**********
**********
Deolu returned from the meeting very exhausted. The meeting had been longer than he anticipated, but what could he do? Nigerian government always wastes too much time talking and debating simple irrelevant issues. He dropped his suit on the bed and started struggling with his tie until he successfully removed it.
He lay on the bed, gazing at the roof until he became tired of looking at it. He stood up and poured himself a glass of juice and walked to the window to look outside. Even though the deal was successful, he wished he was in Lagos, looking for his love. What on earth was he doing in Abuja when his heart was clearly in another state. He had wanted to stop over at the police station to order a search warrant of that miserable Fred but thought it foolish. He felt the guy was hiding somewhere in Lagos, and being a very big place, Lagos is a perfect hiding place. He heard his phone ring and he took it out of his pocket. He smiled when he saw the caller.
“Hello Teju, it is really good to hear from you” he said immediately he received the call.
“Hello Dee” Teju’s voice chiped sweetly but hastily.
Deolu noticed the urgency in her voice. “Is everything Ok over there Teju? Is there any development?” he was at alert.
“Yes. I made some investigations and it seems your going to Abuja is a blessing in disguise”
“What are you saying?”
“Dee, the culprit is in Abuja; Fred is in Abuja”.

_EPISODE 16_

Raymond woke up to the wonderful aroma of hot coffee. At first, he thought his nose was playing tricks on him until he actually woke up fully. The aroma tickled his nostrils and he got up from the bed eagerly. Raymond washed his face and mouth hurriedly; having coffee early in the morning is surely one of the best ways to kick-start a beautiful day. Leaving his room only in shorts and a white singlet, he moved towards the kitchen. There, Luciana stood, still in the gown he had bought for her. He realized she would need more clothes and kept that in mind. Her back was to him and he didn’t really like that. He found himself imagining crazy things which he had to quickly shake off.
Luciana turned backwards when she felt watched and was stunned to find Raymond there.
“Uhm… Good morning sir”
“Raymond” he corrected. “It is a really good morning; the mere fact that I woke up to the delicious scent of piping hot coffee makes today a blessed day”. Luciana smiled happily. “How was your night sugar?”
Luciana was startled at the pet name. Ironically, the pet name which she had once thought was absolutely ridiculous sounded so perfect, coming from his voice. He had this foreign voice, which still sounded completely masculine; more masculine than the voices of the other men she had come across. That single fact made her angry. “I am engaged sir” she replied, staring levelly at him.
Raymond was stunned and offended by the reply. Although, he hadn’t been expecting that reply, he was saddened by the realization of her status. He was although not surprised. Such a dazzling woman cannot remain single, not even when she is fifty. “I did not ask if you were engaged, I simply asked you how your night was. The fact that I called you ‘sugar’ should not be misjudged; I always have a pet name for everyone” he looked insulted.
“I am sorry” she replied, playing at looking at her fingers.
The day had just turned sour, Raymond thought as he sought a way to bring them back on track. He cleared his throat. “I am not sure you had a good night, because if you did, you would not be up this early. You have already made toast bread and coffee; in fact, the scent of the coffee was what woke me up. Was the bed comfortable enough for you?” he looked worried, like a charming host.
“The bed was perfect, thanks. I am just used to waking up very early. I don’t sleep much” she said, smiling.
“Ok… But why did you prepare the coffee? I thought it was my treat, being my specialty”
Luciana laughed. “Look at you… I am sure your coffee is as worse as your attempt to prepare the poundo yam yesterday”
“Ouch”
“When you taste my coffee, you would know that you still have a lot to learn”.
“Nah… I disagree. We need to embark on a coffee competition”
“And who would be the judge?” she raised her eye brows.
“Who else? He raised his shoulders.
“Not you. We need a third party”.
“Right. But for now, I can’t wait to taste that coffee”.
She laughed out. “With or without sugar?” she asked.
He smiled widely. “Yes! You see? I picked the perfect pet name for you”. Luciana glared at him but that only made Raymond’s smile grow wider. “Sugar” he called. “I would definitely have my coffee with sugar”.
Lucy turned away from Raymond quickly, in order to hide the smile that crept to her face. ‘Raymond is a flirt’, she thought.
**********
**********
Fred sat in a bar with countless number of empty bottles on the table before him. He had finished all the bottles of alcoholic wine at home and decided to drink more at the bar near his house. The money he had in his account was fast fading and he feared he would run out of cash within the next few days.
“Another bottle” he yelled and the eager barman hurriedly supplied another bottle of big stout. The fat barman was happy. It the day starts like this, it is sure that market would boom.
Fred, despite the amount of beer in his system, he still had his senses working. Forget his sorrows seemed not to be working. The Chris who would have been in the best position to help him would not do so because of the way he had treated him. He had thrown him out like a stranger. He wondered if his friend would forgive him for what he did and help him get a solution.
“Another bottle”
**********
**********
Deolu sat in the DPO’s office, feeling very impatient. He was there last night but did not get any reasonable response from the hooligans he saw at the station. He had left in frustration to try again the following day. He had been waiting in the office for more than ten minutes and the so called DPO was nowhere to be found.
This is what he hated about Nigerian police; they are too sluggish. When you look for them, you don’t see then; when they finally turn up, you discover they are all selfish thieves. ‘What a miserable country’ he thought. All the same, he still had to wait because taking the law into his hands would land him behind bars. He looked at the police officer who stood like a statue and shook his head.
The door opened and the DPO walked in with a bright smile which annoyed Deolu. “Oh… I am soo sorry for keeping you waiting Mr. Adeolu; I had to attend to some urgent matters”.
“The matter that brought me here is definitely more important and urgent” Deolu replied angrily.
The DPO would have flared up if he didn’t know the status of the person before him. “I am sorry sir. Please, how may I be of service?”
Deolu relaxed. “A murderer and kidnapper is on the loose, here in Abuja”
“What?”
“Yes. I am sure he is responsible for the disappearance of my fiancée, but we have not seen him, or the girl for that matter. This mishap occurred in Lagos but the criminal disappeared along with the girl. After due and thorough investigations, we discovered that he is here in Abuja”
The DPO looked unconvinced. “How sure are you? They probably ran off together; this happens all the time”
“No” he stamped his foot. “My Luciana would NEVER run off with a man, especially not a murderer. He was her friend, the only male friend she had apart from me. He asked her out but she refused. She does not get involved with guys, in fact, she disappeared a day after she said ‘Yes’ to me. That guy, that Fred, was the last person to see her. Her neighbor is a witness”.
“Hmmmm… Do you have their pictures?”
“Yes. Definitely.” He said, pulling out two pictures from his wallet.
Immediately the pictures got to the hand of the DPO, his facial expression changed from curiosity to shock. Deolu noticed this.
“Is there any problem? Do you know any of them?”
“Uhn? Oh… erm… no” he cleared his throat. “Actually, I was just wondering why such a thing would befall such a pretty damsel”. He smiled tightly.
Deolu nodded, not exactly pleased that the DPO was checking out his babe, his woman. “I hope you would swing to action immediately”
“Yeah yeah. Of course. We are here to serve you. The police are your friends in times of need”.
“Noted”. Deolu said and stood up. He stopped at the door and turned back. “By the way, please what is your name?”
“Oh… I? I am Chris; Chris Chuks”.

_EPISODE 17_

Evening came without notice. Raymond was fun to be with and they did not even know when evening came. Though Raymond had tried all day not to talk about the obvious problem at hand, Lucy still found herself thinking about her family. She could not leave them to wander in total darkness. She wondered if Fred was still moving freely. That guy should be locked in an isolated room without remembrance. She sat on the chair, looking at the TV but her mind was not there. Raymond who was on another chair was busy looking at her, he noticed her distant state but kept mute. He felt her pain but still could not understand what could possibly happen if she went to her people. The murderer would want to eliminate her since she could implicate him but Luciana was practically not worried about herself but her people. His resolve to take matters into his hands had fallen when he could not break his promise. He wondered why he always found it extremely hard.
Luciana suddenly jerked. Ray turned towards the television immediately and understood what was happening with fright. The broadcast he had watched the previous day was being repeated. Her picture was displayed on the screen with her name written beneath it. The bold ‘MISSING’ letters were just above the picture. A very unbrlievable amount was promised as a reward for anyone who has any information. Luciana jumped up and ran into the room before any tear could drop from her eyes.
“Lucia… Lucia…” Ray called, chasing after her. He relaxed a bit before opening the door of the room. He met her sitting on the bed, but she was not crying. She was struggling with tears. She was trying to be brave. His heart could not bear it. He did not know the one he would have preferred, her brave front or a crying beauty.
He sat beside her, not knowing whether or not to touch her. He had rarely touched her ever since they left the hospital and he was actually scared of what would happen or how she would react if he tried to hold her.
“It’s OK sugar. It is perfectly OK to cry” he whispered. One tear drop slid down her cheeks and that seemed to send the others an invitation. She broke down in tears and Raymond became totally confused. Women in tears always sent a shiver down his spine because he always would not know what to do. He pulled her into his arms as he tried consoling her. His heartbeat raced as she placed her head on his chest. He bent his head and kissed her forehead and she cried. He felt her pain and her tears brought back painful memories that he did not even want to open. She could not stop her tears and he just held on to her, whispering words of solace. When she would not stop crying, Raymond started wondering what the cause of her tears really was. He had the awkward feeling that she was crying for something much more than the pain her family was going through. What did that murderer say to her? He wondered.
“Do you want to talk about it?” he asked quietly, when her tears died down. She relunctantly left his arms when all she wanted was to be held by his strong arms. Ray wished she did not leave his arms. He wanted to hold her in his arms, protect her, comfort her and… he shook his head. He had to get that weird thought out of his mind for his own good.
Luciana marched to the window. “I need to make a phone call. I need to call someone”.
Ray was confused. “What are you talking about?”
“I need to tell someone that I am alive. I would call my best friend, Teju. She is the only one that would be discrete enough; she is a lawyer”.
“Are you sure about this?”
She nodded.
Raymond took out his phone while Lucy called the phone number from memory. After the phone rang for some time, it was picked and Raymond put the phone on speaker.
“Hello” Teju said from the other end.
“Hello, please am I speaking with Miss Teju” Ray asked, although he already got the confirmation in Lucy’s smile, the brightest smile he had seen ever since he knew her. She was battling with the urge to snatch the phone from his hands.
“That depends on who is calling” she replied. Truly a lawyer, Raymond thought.
“Well, it take that as a ‘Yes’. Someone here wants to talk to you”. Without wasting much time he passed the phone to Lucy who grabbed it eagerly.
“Hello T.J.” she said impatiently with smiles all over her face.
“JESUS” Teju screamed.
**********
**********
bewaji moved her nude body close to her husband. She was feeling better than she had been in days. Ken smiled and opened his eyes. He felt her braided hair withnhis fingers as he smile down at her. Bewaji was smiling too and that made him really glad.
“It is good to see your smiling face again honey” ken said with a smile.
“All thanks to you” she poked him. “You know, I have a good feeling that my baby is alive”.
Ken nodded. “My princess can’t be dead; no. we just have to calm down and use our heads collectively.”
“I am not sure I would be able to do that” she became sober again.
“That is why I am here to help you with that. I would find her or die trying” he bent and kissed her.
Bewaji smiled faintly. “you make me feel like a teenager again”
Ken looked at her body slowly. “You look like one” he pulled her close and kissed her.
**********
**********
Teju was standing at the middle of her office, looking awkwardly with her left hand in the air and the other holding her phone against her ear. If she hadn’t trained herself well on shock reception, the phone would have slipped off her fingers. Her heart raced fast as she assumed that she was not hearing properly. Only one person called her T.J and she would identify that voice anywhere.
“Lu… Lucy? Lucy? Is that you?” her voice was shaky, along with her fingers.
“Yes T.J, I am the one” Lucy’s voice sounded tear-filled. “I am alive” she yelled.
“I can’t believe this! Am I dreaming?” Teju asked, bewildered.
Lucy laughed. “Maybe you are; don’t wake up”
“Not even in a thousand years” teju replied, knowing that she would never want to wake up until the dream becomes a reality. Luciana laughed again at the other end.
“What happened Lucy? Why did you vanish into thin air like that? You almost killed everyone here. Mum and dad have almost gone crazy in their search. I have checked virtually all the hospitals in Lagos; Deolu is almost going crazy, along with all your friends and colleagues at work. what happened and where the hell are you?”
There was silence at the other end and Teju knew that she must have confused Lucy with all the stories she laid down. “It is a long story. Please promise me you would not breathe this to any soul.”
“What do you mean by that? Everyone is searching endlessly for you. I need to tell them that you contacted me and you need to come home”.
“No T.J.I would put everyone and myself in danger if I come now. I was stabbed by Fred and he dumped me somewhere, thinking I was dead. The person I am with is the good Samaritan that helped me. For some reasons, I think it is best if I stay away. Let him assume me dead; it is better. Please T.J help me ensure he is arrested. I would not be able to rest until he is behind bars”
Teju was silent for a while. “It would be hard keeping this everyone, but as for that filthy maggot, he is as good as dead. We already suspected that bastard. Your mum dreamt about him”, she laughed, “your neighbor also said he was at your place late at night. We are searching for him. We feel he is in Abuja and Deolu is there to fish him out”.
“Really?” Lucy screamed.
“Yes babe. We are holding our end but I still need to know what happened that day”
“Maybe later. Please help me calm everyone, especially mum and dad, without disclosing my whereabouts”
“Will try; at least I don’t know where you are, so I would not be lying”.
“Lawyer…” Lucy laughed slightly at the other end.
**********
**********
Raymond had been beaming with smiles all through the conversation. He watched with interest as Lucy conversed with her friend, seeing the bond that was between them. He loved the light he saw in her eyes but also saw the pain when she heard all they were going through because of her.
When the call ended, Lucy was so happy that she just jumped into Raymond’s arms. She was so estatic. The fact that Fred was on the run made her joy even bigger. She held on to Ray as she laughed and spoke endlessly about how happy she was. Ray shared her joy and was similarly happy for her. Her laughter died down and she had to leave Ray’s arms. She left slowly, feeling reluctant. Silence enveloped them and the tension grew. Ray stepped closer without thinking and brushed the strands of stray hair that fell across her face. Words did not come as he gazed into her eyes.
“I erm…” Lucy jumped out of his arms. She tried looking for something to say. Raymond’s phone rang and saved her from the trouble. She exhaled as Raymond swallowed and picked his call.

_EPISODE 18_

Lucy woke up with a start and looked out of the window. It was already getting bright outside so she lifted herself from the bed. She had never missed any Sunday service and she didn’t plan on starting now. She left for the bathroom to take her bath. She should be able to get one church around the corner.
The previous day had been fun, so much fun. Raymond hadn’t exaggerated his sister’s lively and accommodating spirit. Vicky just finished her masters in the United States and she was back to stay. Lucy wondered why people come back to this frustrating country after schooling abroad when there was obviously nothing in store for them here in Nigeria. She had later shrugged it off, knowing that those who studied abroad had more chances at getting a good job, compared with those who attended our local institutions. She found that ironic because it ought to be the other way. Everything in Nigeria is abnormal. Before Vicky arrived, Ray had taken her shopping for some nice clothes. She had argued and complained about being a burden but Ray would have none of it. He had made sure she got all the clothes that caught her fancy even though she tried minimizing it. After they had purchased everything he had left her at the counter and returned with a very lovely gown. She had wondered how she missed that gown. It was so beautiful. Even without testing it, she knew it would be perfect.
As she dressed up, she heard a knock on the door. “Please, come in”.
Vicky entered the room with a smile. “Good morning Vic” Lucy greeted. She had imagined that they would be within the same age bracket. “Did you sleep well in Nigeria?”
Vicky laughed. “Obviously” she said in her foreign assent. “I don’t need to be told that you woke up well. Are you going somewhere?”
“Today is Sunday, I am going to church” Luciana replied, a bit surprised that the question was even asked.
“Oh… You are the church type” she said with a smirk. “Well, I stopped going to church years back”.
“I see…” Lucy murmured solemly. The glint she saw in Vic’s eyes showed that she would have little or no luck if she tried convincing her. “Why?” she asked
“Several reasons”
“Give me one” Lucy challenged.
“I am a lesbian”
Lucy froze on the spot with her back Vicky. She knew that the best way to deal with people like that is not by accusing them or by making them feel like the world’s biggest sinner. She wondered if Ray knew this then knew that he would know. She had noticed the way he watched the two of them discuss, like he was trying to prevent something. She swallowed.
“Is that why you refused to go to church?”
Vicky was stunned. “You are not surprised?”
Lucy turned with a smile. “Surprised about what? That you said you are a lesbian? I was surprised. Who told you?”
“Nobody had to; I knew. Everyone made me feel miserable, like I was the most evil thing that ever walked the planet”.
Lucy smiled. She had finished her dressing. She did not have a bible, so she just carried the small bag that Ray bought for her. She moved to Vicky and hugged her. “You’ll be fine. Take your time.” She moved back and smiled at her before she started towards the door. Vicky was stonned. No Christian had ever done that to her. “I would get Ray to follow me to church” Lucy said at the door.
Vicky smiled widely. “Goodluck with that”
Lucy frowned but bid farewell and headed towards Raymond’s room.
**********
**********
Fred lay on the couch of his house feeling tired. He had spent too much at that bar and was feeling very miserable and tired. His account was now a skeleton of its former state. He pulled out a cigarette and lit it. He was just learning to smoke; he needed to clear his head and the smoke was doing that for him. He heard a knock on the door and became startled. He jumped up and stood like a stick.
Chris stood at the door, expecting the door to be opened from inside but he remembered the last encounter he had and knew that it would not be opened anytime soon if he did not talk.
“Fred” he called. “Open up, it is Chris”
Fred breathed a free air and opened the door. He was both relieved and scared of Chris’ visit. He did not know if this would be a good or bad visit, considering the way he treated him weeks back.
“Chris… I am so happy that you are here. I am sorry for what happened the last time. I know…” he stopped and looked at Chris for the first time. He was glaring at him.
Chris needed no other confirmation; the shaky state he was and the previous encounter told him that he had actually commited the crime. He shook his head, making Fred feel cold dread.
Chris put his hand inside his pocket and took out a picture. “Do you know her”
Fred almost entered the ground as he shrieked.
**********
**********
Luciana stood bemused at the entrance of Raymond’s room. She still could not comprehend what she had heard in the room. Vicky? How could Vicky be a lesbian? She shook her and swallowed.
She knocked the door gently but heard a sleepy response. She opened the door gently and entered. Immediately she entered, she blamed herself. Raymond was looking so manly and georgeous as he slept, shirtless on the bed. Her fingers desired to touch him and she felt anger in her spine. How can a man make her swoon? She wondered.
Ray noticed the way Lucy looked at him but he hid it, pretending to be sleeping. He swallowed as he took in her appearance. When he took out that gown, he never imagined that she would look so stunning. She had almost no make – up done but she looked more beautiful that all the women he had seen in his life.
Lucy shook herself and tried to pull herself together. “Good morning sir” she said loudly, trying to wake Raymond.
Raymond smiled softly as he opened his eyes. “You are a wonderful sight to wake up to sugar; you look breathtaking”. Ray traced her body with his appreciative eyes.
Luciana breathed carefully as she tried to take out the image of her shirtless chest from her mind. “Why don’t you get in the bathroom, get dressed and let’s go to church”
“Church?” he asked, bemused.
“Yes, church. You told me you are a Christian, right? Today is Sunday.”
“I don’t attend churches” he said and lay on the bed.
Lucy opened her mouth. “Why not?”
“No reason” he murmured.
“Well, I don’t know anywhere in this place. I might as well get lost, you know. Or maybe, I would just go home from there, and if the murderer sees me? well…”
“keep Quiet” he yelled softly. “Go and wait for me” he said softly and Lucy chuckled as she left the room.
**********
**********
Teju returned from church with a happy mood. She had loved the service immensely, right from the very beginning. She felt that the reason why she was so happy was the fact that she knew where her best friend was. She heard a knock and, knowing the person at the door, she went to open the door.
“Welcome darling” she said, stressing the darling. She tried to hug him but he was cold towards her. Tunde moved inside without responding to her greeting. She frowned. “Honey? Baby, what is wrong?” she asked moving close to him as she sat on the chair beside him.
“Teju” he called and she knew that everything was wrong. He hardly called her by her name.
“Teju, I believe we are mature enough to be able to talk to eachother like adults”. He started.
“Tunde, we have been talking like adults ever since we met. What is the problem?” she was confused.
He shook slightly. “Teju, I don’t think we can continue with this relationship. I have seen another girl that I am in love with. We should maturely go out separate ways”.

_EPISODE 19_

“Why did you do that?” Lucy asked as she joined Raymond in the car.
Ray started the car. “Do what?”
“Stay in the car? You could have followed me inside the church instead of sitting outside here like a bodyguard. What did God do to offend your family”?
“Nothing.”
Lucy kept quiet after that. She hadn’t even spent three days and she was already overstepping her bounds. The drive home was quiet after that. She missed her people a lot and she wished she was home already. She needed to hear her parents’ voice, to be sure they are ok. She thought about Deolu and her heart pricked. She needed to leave the house. She needed her people and sanity back. Ever since the previous day when she had called Teju in the presence of Raymond, she had felt very uncomfortable with him, especially whenever he stood close. She sighed softly when she thought of her predicament. She was living with total strangers; they both don’t want to have anything to do with God and one of them is a lesbian. She sighed again, thinking about the many things she might find out about this family if she stayed for some time.
Raymond watched Lucy, noticing her distant state. He wondered why her mood should bother him. Shrugging off her quietness, he focused on the road as he pondered on the thoughts that had plagued him. Why was he developing strange feelings for this lady who was obviously engaged to someone else? She hadn’t even spent three complete days and he had become so attached to her. He remembered the past evening and his heart skipped a beat, he had to hold the steering tighter. The desire to kiss her had almost overwhelmed him. Ever since then, he had ensured that he did not move close to her. He only needed space in his life now and not anyother woman to complicate his life the more. The earlier Lucy left the house, the better.
**********
**********
Teju sat frozen as she stared with a confused expression on her face. Tunde did not have the boldness to look into her eyes as he said everything he had rehearsed.
“Teju” he called softly but she did not even blink. “I can’t do this anymore. You claim to love me but you don’t want to give me what should rightfully belong to me. I have a right to touch your body; it is part of the benefits I should derive from being your man, but you are not giving me. I have found a lady who is willing to go all the way with me. she does not hide anything from me, least of all her body”. He concluded.
Teju looked at the clown she called her fiancé and wanted to strangulate him. She had tried all she could to be the best woman in his life. She could have sworn that she had spent the past two years of their relationship making his life a happy one. She couldn’t have been more wrong because all he could think about was sex. Sex? How could she have been so stupid? She remembered all those times he had almost forced her into his bed; she should have been wiser then. She swallowed as tears came to her eyes. She blinked away the tears; he does not deserve it.
Slowly, she took a deep breath as stood up and went to the door. She opened the door, wide enough to contain two people at once. Only then did she open her mouth. “Leave” she said quietly.
Tunde swallowed. “Teju, I am sorry. I just…”
“Get out” she mouthed.
He stood up slowly and approached her. “Baby, calm-”
“GET OUT” she yelled and Tunde vanished in a flash. She slammed the door forcefully and collapsed on the floor as she cried herself out.
**********
**********
Chris needed no other confirmation. He got every answer he needed from Fred’s reaction. He could never in a hundred years, imagine that Fred had the capacity to take a life but the reality was staring at him like a horror movie.
“Don’t you dare give me that melodrama, you this miserable monster. I don’t even know who you are anymore” he yelled at a shivring Fred. He grabbed Fred by the collar of his shirt and pulled him up like a bloody criminal. “Where the hell is the girl? Where did you keep her?” he yelled.
Fred shook like someone who just emerged from a cold room. “She… she’s… she’s dead” he stammered.
“JESUS” Chris screamed, leaving Fred immediately. “Oh my God! This can’t be happening. I can’t believe this”
Fred held his feet. “Please Chris, you have to help me. please…”
Chris kicked him away. “Blood of Jesus! So, you are a bloody murderer?” he pointed his finger with a strange look on his face.
“NO” Fred shook his head vigorously. “I did not want to do it. It was accidental. Please believe me brother”
“Brother?” he laughed. “No. I am not your brother and can never be. You killed a girl; not just a girl; the fiancée of Mr Adeolu. You could not even pick any other person? Wow”
Fred cried as Chris said those things. “Please”. Chris shook his head, pushed Fred out of the way and rushed out of the house like someone who was being pursued, leaving Fred wailing.
**********
**********
Lucy walked with Vicky towards the back of the house to check the flowers. She carried the watering can in order to water them. They both discussed their love for flowers as they went about watering the flowers. The beautiful colours of the various flowers pleased Lucy immensely and she said so. She sighted the two buildings at the back of the house and called Vicky’s attention.
“What are those buildings for?” she asked casually.
“Oh… the first one is the gym and the second one is where Raymond paints” she chipped as she sampled the flowers.
“Paints? He paints?” Lucy asked bemused as her eyes widened.
Vicky turned to look at Lucy like she had lost her mind. “Don’t tell me you don’t know”
Lucy shook her head. “He never mentioned it”
“Even at that, he is a very famous artist”
Lucy had never really fancied paintings because it never really freeked her but as she thought about it, a name struck her. ‘James Ray’. How had she missed that? Teju never stopped talking about his paintings but she never even took interest. “James Ray?”
“That’s him” she smiled. “I am surprised you missed that. Although he has not painted anything for a long time now” she chipped.
Lucy frowned. “Why?”
Vicky shrugged and walked on, leaving Lucy with her thoughts.
“Hey”
Lucy turned round to see Ray standing just a few steps from her. “When were you planning on telling me that you are a renowned artist?” she asked, stepping farther away from him.
“I never would have told you. I am no longer an artist and I actually loved the fact that I finally met someone who was not drooling over me because of my fame”. he replied walking away.
Lucy followed. “I am not drooling over you at all”.
Ray laughed. “I noticed”
**********
**********
Deolu exited the bathroom and dried himself with a towel. he wore a singlet and boxers and sat on the bed. Staying in a hotel had little or no effect on his account but he wished he was home already. The knowledge that Fred was lurking somewhere in the state made him feel better about leaving Lagos for work but he still felt miserable. He knew that even without being present, he could pull all the strings he needed to pull in order to secure Fred’s arrest. He needed to finish this deal, go back to Lagos and look for his love. He had the distinctive feeling that Lucy was in Lagos and he would find her, even if it was the last thing he did.
He had received a call from Lucy’s dad and he had told him about his progress in Abuja. He had been happy but the sadness of his missing daughter was evident in his voice. Deolu dialed Teju’s line and it rang severally but she did not pick up. He was beginning to get worried. He had called her severally but she didn’t pick up. He composed a message asking about her welfare and telling her how far he had gone then he lay on the bed to sleep. Worry did not afford him the luxury of a wonderful sleep.
Twenty minutes later, he dialed Teju’s number again and she picked, much to his relief.
“Hello Teju, thank God.” he sighed. The response he got from her frightened him. Her voice had never been that low and depressed. “What is the matter T? Are you alright?”
“I am fine” she responded still in that sober manner.
“You are not fine” Deolu said, sitting up. “What happened to you? Did you hear from Lucy? Did something happen?”
“Everything is fine, don’t worry. I got your message and I would work on it and give you feedback.”
“Teju, you are scaring me. You know what? Since you would not tell me what the matter is, I would leave this place for Lagos tomorrow morning.” he said as he stood up.
“No” she replied sharply. “You need to be there Dee”
“No. I should not have come in the first place. I can do everything in Lagos. I am coming over”. Before Teju could respond, he hung up and started packing his things. Teju called severally but he did not pick, knowing she would just try to convince him.

_EPISODE 20_

Lucy washed the rice as she conversed with Vicky who checked the chicken in the oven. She was enjoying the conversation imensely but she could not help missing Raymond. He had resumed work about a week ago and Lucy had missed him with each passing day. Vicky was definitely fun to be with but she had grown so used to Ray that she felt his absence a lot.
“But my time in London was a real disaster” Vicky said
Lucy turned with a bemused expression. “Why did you say that?”
“I was despised because I am a lesbian” she sighed. “I just wanted death. It was harder because no one in my family was in support of me. My parents condemned me totally and I became the black sheep of the family. London made it worse and I hid behind my shell until I was able to leave”. She was sober and sat on the chair.
Lucy stared at Vicky, feeling her pain. She was confused as to what to say so she just kept quiet. Vicky took her quietness for condemnation.
“I am sure you see me as the worst kind of human being. It is fine; I get that all the time”.
Lucy smiled. “That is beautiful?”
Vicky frowned. “What is beautiful?”
“That hair bond. It is absolutely lovely”
Vic smiled. “I got it from London. It is actually the only thing I bought there. Just wanted to have something from London in order to remember my time there, even if it was not so pleasant”
“I love it and I love you; in a platonic way though. You are a wonderful person; you just need someone to show you how wonderful love is. Love is a beautiful thing”.
Vicky swallowed and shook her head. “I can’t love a man; I have tried in vain”.
Luciana smiled and turned to check the food. “I am not asking you to try; in fact, you would not have to try”.
“I don’t understand” Vic replied, confused.
“Don’t worry. You would be fine. Let’s finish this delicacy.” She said as continued her cooking.
**********
**********
Teju sat facing a client at a popular cafeteria not too far from her office. She had preferred an open environment to the confinement of her office because she was beginning to feel choked lately. It had been over a week but that episode with Tunde kept replaying itself in her brain. Everything Mr. Popoola was saying was barely noted by her as she sat frozen on the chair with her eyes glued on her client and her face as blank as a plain sheet.
Deolu had arrived Lagos just as he said he would but she could not unburden herself. She felt that he already had enough problems and bothering him with hers would be wicked of her. She had to lie to him that her mood was due to a court case she lost. She wished her parents were not dead. She missed her mother a lot. She needed someone to talk to, someone to comfort her, but she found no one. Even her friends were not able to help her. Lucy would have understood, she knew.
As Teju stared at Mr. Popoola’s face, all she could see was Tunde. She wished he was just in front of her so she could show him the stuff she was made of. The door of the cafeteria opened up and Teju could not believe what she was seeing. She had just been wishing to find Tunde and there he was, coming into the cafeteria with a half nude girl on his arm. Seeing the girl’s dressing, Teju knew that he left her because of sex. Tunde did not see her, considering the size of the place and the sizeable amount of people in it.
“Barrister” Mr. Popoola called and she turned her head like a robot. “You are not listening to me” he said, a bit irritated.
Teju relayed everything Mr. Popoola had been saying without missing a thing and he was so surprised. He knew that she had been lost in thoughts and found it amazing that she had actually heard all he was saying. Teju smiled at his amusement. “I have heard everything I want to know, if there is any other information I need, I would call you sir. If you don’t mind sir, I need to attend to some people”. He smiled sheepishly, knowing that whatever it was had nothing to do with business.
“Go easy on them” he said softly.
Teju stood up and her client did the same. She did not bother responding; she knew that he would have seen the way she looked at Tunde when he entered. After several verbal exchanges, Mr. Popoola left. She took a deep breath as she approached the table ahead. Tunde had his back to her, so he did not see her. She got to the table, with a frozen smile on her face.
“So, this is the girl that you are in love with?” Tunde looked up and blanched.
**********
**********
Ray was becoming much more tense by the minute. He stood up and roamed his office and sat back after pacing aimlessly. He never imagined that he could miss someone so terribly. He missed Luciana so much, it hurt. He missed her smile, he quiet and thoughtful times, her lively kitchen life and every single thing that summed up the fair goddess he was hosting in his house. Ever since he resumed work, he had wished he was managing one of his father’s companies so that he would be able to leave the house whenever he liked.
He had made that adamant decision to be independent when he was 23 years old. He had finished his studies with outstanding certificates but his father wanted him to head his companies. He had refused and had gone job hunting, in the quest to build something of his own. His father later came through and gave him his blessings, much to his relief and delight. The prayers of his parents worked wonders for him because he got a job with an oil company not quite long. It was all he ever dreamt of. At first, the salary was just normal, due to his position but as time went on, his salary was reviewed and promotions started rolling in. He made good use of the money coming in, buying shares and making investments. His house came as a result of his labour and his parents became proud of him.
Painting, which was his God-given talent, was what he always loved and enjoyed doing. Painting was already out of the window of his life; it had become one of his nightmares.
The door of Raymond’s office flung open and Ray had to snap out of his reverie. Duke bounced into the office without any prior notice but that was just like him. Ray was already used to Duke’s impromptu visits and even Ray’s zealous secretary can’t make Duke wait in the reception for a minute.
“This is my office Duke, I work here. Are you trying to get me fired?” Ray glared as he closed the door which Duke did not bother closing.
Duke paused. “That is the best greeting I have ever heard, also the longest”. He stated but Ray glared instead. “Ok, no one is going to fire your sorry ass. You are the manager here and that position comes with a lot of benefits, including going for lunch earlier than usual”.
“Halt. I am not going anywhere, especially not an 11 o’clock lunch”. Ray made his way to his seat.
Duke checked his watch. “This is almost 12” he declared.
“Obviously” Ray sighed.
“Listen, I think you need that lunch, especially since I found you standing aimlessly at the middle of your office during office hours. That lunch would help ease the stress” he smiled.
“Man, I just resumed work after a one month leave”. He stated.
“Quit the lecture James Ray, you are coming with me” he stood up, daring Ray not to comply.
Ray shook his head in surrender.
**********
**********
“Hi, I am Teju” she stretched her hand towards the wide-eyed lady who dumbly took it.
“I am Oyin” she replied.
“What are you doing here Teju?” Tunde growled.
Teju eyed him slowly before pulling a chair. After seating, she faced the lady who was practically confused. “I do not intend to waste your time, just want to have a little chat with you. Do you mind?”
“Yes, she minds. Leave” Tunde dropped.
“Would you shut your filthy mouth?” Teju yelled, drawing attention. “I am here to speak with this beautiful bitch here, so shut the trash”.
“How dare you call me a bitch?” oyin stood up furiously. “What is the meaning of this nonsense Tunde?”
“Sit down now” Teju yelled. “You don’t want to know the angry part of Teju, I am telling you. SIT” she smiled tightly. Oyin looked a bit scared but she hid it. She thought about what was going on and decided it best to sit. Teju smiled as she stared at Oyin’s rage-stricken face.
“Good. I just want to talk about your friend here – Tunde” she started.
“Teju” Tunde groaned.
“I would not get mad at you for stealing my fiancé, no I won’t. In fact, you did me a huge favour”
Oyin stared at her. “What are you saying?”
“Oh… he did not tell you? He was my fiancé until last week. We had our wedding date fixed for December which should be six months from now” Teju laughed. “Funny right? I was busy thinking about our wedding night while he was thinking about another woman’s ass. I am not here to drag him from you, you can totally have him, but I want to advice you. Don’t think that the only way to get a man is by spreading your legs wide enough to accommodate him”
“How dare you?” Oyin yelled as she stood up. Teju dragged her down immediately.
“You don’t want to cause a scene.”
“Teju-”
“If you dare call my name again, you would hate me” Teju half yelled. She faced Oyin “Where were we? Yes, your legs. Do you know why he left me for you? It is because your legs were wide open. He does not love you, he just loves that thing you offer to him free of charge. When did you meet? I am sure it is not even a month ago. Oh, who am I kidding? It can’t even be three weeks ago.
“Men are the same. They are never contented with what they have; they are always looking for extra until they lose what they had before. When this miserable being left me last week, my eyes opened and I got a new meaning to the word ‘man’. A man is a miserable adulterous nuisance who goes from skirt to skirt, seeking whom to devour. Thank God I wear trousers; it makes it harder to devour me. I have just one advice for you: redefine your life”
“Oh, I see. And where did your redefined life get you uhn?” Oyin asked, glaring.
Teju smiled softly, stood up and wore her sunshade. “It saved me from Tunde” she said and walked out, leaving the couple enveloped in serious tension. She got to the door and collided with someone coming into the cafeteria.
“Easy beauty” Duke said but she just walked away. “What a pretty babe”.
Ray shook his head. “Always a flirt!” Ray declared. “Vicky is back from the states”. Duke swallowed and walked on with a straight face. Ray smiled.

_EPISODE 21_

Fred opened the door to Chris office and entered slowly. He had the distinctive feeling that he would get thrown out if he went in all confident. When Chris’ glare welcomed him, he swallowed.
“Why not hear me out first before you nail me to the cross” Fred said in a pleading manner.
“Jesus was not given that opportunity, why should you be given” Chris responded with a permanent glare.
“Jesus was nailed unjustly, would you do the same to me?”
Chris looked at him. “You have five minutes to convince me. You better start now because I won’t give you a second more”.
Fred sat instantly. “It was an accident Chris. I went to her house to confess my love for her, just as I told you but when I got there and bared my heart to her, she laughed at me. She said that she could never have anything to do with me, that she would never date a loser when Deolu was there. I saw a knife close by and I took it just to scare her since she would not stop talking but she tripped over something on the floor and because I was not far behind, I also tripped and the knife I was holding stabbed her. I swear it was not intentional. Please believe me” Fred shook.
Chris looked doubtful. “Are you sure of what you are saying?”
“Yes Chris. That is how it happened. When she… when she died, I had to erm… dump her somewhere. I was so scared, please help me”
Chris Chuks stared at Fred who just sat, shivering on the chair opposite him. He had a feeling that what Fred had just said was only a shadow of the real truth. Although, seeing the way Fred shivered, he was compelled to believe him.
“Well, I have not told anyone anything and have been lying to Mr Adeolu for close to two weeks now. I was not able to implicate your sorry ass. You need to leave that house. I have a good place where you can hide for the mean time; hiding in that house is very predictable and they would easily find you there”
“Thank you brother. I knew I could count on you” Fred said with a lot of appreciation in his voice.
Chris swallowed. He was putting his job and neck on the line for Fred. He could be charged for treason. He relaxed and closed his eyes hoping that this issue does not backfire.

**********
Lucy sat chatting with Raymond in the sitting room. He had arrived earlier than usual and Lucy was happy because Vicky had gone to spend a few days with her friend. Being in that massive house all alone would have been terrifying, especially since the house was not hers. As they discussed, she thought of how to put down what she had in mind.
“Ray” she called.
Raymond turned to face her suddenly. “This is the first time you called me by my name; I love the sound of it. You should call me that often.” He grinned.
Lucy blushed and looked down. “Erm… I … erm”
Ray frowned. “What is it sugar? Is something wrong?”
“No… erm… what I want to say… I mean, ask is if you could show me some of your art works”
Ray blanched.
“I don’t mean to pry but Teju had talked endlessly about your artworks but I was never interested. Your paintings are very popular even though I never took the time to check them out. I would love to have a look, even if it is just a few” she finished.
Ray was quiet, too quiet. He swallowed as he stared into space.
“If it is a problem, please don’t bother. It is nothing” she quickly added.
Ray stood up and went to his bedroom. Lucy felt bad and miserable. She must have done and said everything wrong. The paintings must bring bad memories. Several thoughts went through her head as she sat frozen to her seat.
Raymond appeared minutes later with a key in his hand. He marched out and muttered ‘follow me’. She did not want to follow him like this; with him being upset.
“If you are not OK with it, it is fine. You don’t have to.” She murmured as she followed him. He did not respond. When they got to the door, he opened it slowly and stood at the entrance.
“Go inside. Everything you need is there.” He said and moved out of the way.
Lucy stared at him with concern. “If you would not go with me then I won’t go at all. You can’t run away from the past, you just have to accept the past”.
Ray swallowed. “I am not going inside” he dropped icily.
Lucy winced as she saw the pain in his eyes. “I am not going too. Please lock the door. I was never interested in art in the first place”.
Ray looked at her. He wanted to make her believe that art was a wonderful thing but he was scared of going into the room. He opened the door wider and started entering. Lucy breathed and followed. Her eyes widened as she stared at the numerous frames hung on the wall, all around the room and the ones on the floor. She had never seen anything so beautiful and colourful. Everything her eyes met was simply outstanding. She touched some of them, tracing them with her finger. She noticed they were dusty but knew that it was expected if the place had been under lock for some time. She saw a painting of a woman who was seated with her baby on her lap. The look of love in the woman’s eyes was so evident and real, she could feel it. Her eyes watered as she remembered her mother at home. “This is beautiful; everything is beautiful” she murmured as she blinked. Ray smiled but did not say anything.
Lucy looked around and every frame called her but one of them struck her and her heart skipped. She walked like a robot to the painting. When she got there, she could not touch it, she just looked. She was dumbstruck as she stared at the most amazing painting she had seen. It was a painting of a man and a woman. The woman had pain in her eyes as she stared at the man. The pain in the eyes of the man was not as intense but there was also love in both eyes. There was someone in the shadow. The face and form of the person was not clear but there was someone there; she knew it. The person stood with his back to them. The painting told a story of two lovers who had gone through a trying time but still loved eachother. She imagined that the person in the shadow was against their union. The couple looked vaguely familiar. She turned and looked at Raymond and got her answer.
“Are these your parents?” she asked.
He swallowed. “Yes” he mouthed. He wanted to run out of the room. That painting was his favorite. His eyes watered as he anticipated the next question she would ask.
“Where are they?” she asked as she looked at the painting again. He was quiet. She turned and saw him struggling for composure. She became scared and worried.
“They are dead”. He turned and left the room. She stood rooted to the ground. Dead? Was this the nightmare? Was that why he stopped painting? She wondered. She stared ahead and saw something like an uncompleted work. It was as if he started and could not continue. She could not even decipher what the painting looked like.
She ran out of the room to go after Ray but saw him match into the gym. She sighed as she closed the door of the room. She wondered if she should go after him or just let him go. She chose the former and headed towards the gym.

**********
Deolu had called the police officer but never got good news from him. He became frustrated and remembered another police officer in Abuja. He wondered how he had skipped that. He took out his phone and dialed.
**********
**********
When Lucy entered the gym, she saw Raymond on the treadmill, running endlessly. It was like trying to run away from something. Lucy’s heart ached as she saw this. He was in pain but was too arrogant to admit it to anyone. She went to sit somewhere close where he could see her easily but he did not see her. He did not seem to know she was there. It was like he was in another world where all he could see were ghosts of the past.
Ray ran and ran and with each step he took, he ran faster. The more he ran, the more those images flashed through his mind. He was going crazy; maybe he was already crazy. He had thought he would be able to handle it. It had been almost four years since the incident occurred and he still could not forget. The images were still as fresh as yesterday. When he entered the room, he had thought that seeing those drawings would not affect him. They hadn’t until Lucy drew his attention to that picture. That was what broke the confidence he had. Everything came rushing back: the departure of their parents and the circumstances that led to it, the news of the crash, their trip to the accident scene, the burnt people, the faces of his dead and burnt parents… Raymond screamed and jumped out of the treadmill.
Lucy ran to meet him as he shook uncontrollably. She wondered what demon had possessed her to ask for his paintings. She was scared. Scared for him, scared for herself. “Please take it easy Ray. Please…” she lamented, her eyes already wet with tears. Ray’s shirt was already soaked in his sweat and he did not seem to be able to stop his shivering body.
“They died Lucy… They died horribly… The plane crashed… They got burnt… My parents…” he continued to say and a cold shiver went down Lucy’s spine. A plane crash! “I saw them Lucy…” tears dropped from his eyes. “I saw all of them. I saw their burnt bodies… they were roasted Lucy… Oh God… roasted… like animals” he held her head and looked into her eyes, trying to make her understand. “My loving parents died horribly. What did my parents do to deserve that? They served God and ensured that we did too. Why were they in that plane” more tears dropped from his eyes and Lucy just kept on crying. She had never seen that much pain before. She was lost on what to do. Ray could not drive away the images. He wanted to forget. He just wanted to forget. Lucy stood up tip-toes on the first impulse that came to her head and kissed him deeply.

_EPISODE 22_

Luciana jumped out of Ray’s hands. She could not believe her effrontery. The kiss only lasted for a second and immediately she attempted it, she remembered Deolu. She had no right to kiss a stranger, even if he was in pain. Deolu was also in pains at home trying to look for her and here she was, kissing a total stranger who seemed to have more ghosts in his life than real beings. But even as the thought flashed through her head, she stared at Ray with concern. He was no longer shivering, he just stood, staring at her. It did not look as if tears had dropped from his eyes; his face just looked blank with the hint of confusion. The tears didn’t really qualify to be called tears because it was just a few drops, but tears they were nonetheless. She guessed he was too arrogant to admittedly cry, especially not in front of a girl.
“Oh my !” Ray exclaimed. “I am sorry”
Lucy blinked. “You did not do anything wrong; I am at fault” she quickly countered. “Don’t give more meaning to it. I was just trying to calm you down since I was the one who got you upset. Let’s call it a calling kiss. Guess it worked” she smiled faintly
“First of all, you did not upset me. I should have gotten over this incident but it seems stuck in my brain. Secondly, you can’t call that kiss a calming technique; I have been known to be a good kisser, you know. I can give you a proper kiss” he humoured but it only made her frown and shift uncomfortably.
“Of course, I know that you have a erm… guy but I was just trying to make you smile, dimples” he said and she did smile. He had added dimples to her pet name when her dimples kept calling to him. He also noticed that whenever he called her that, it brought a smile to her face.
“Thanks” he said, jamming his hands into his pocket before he did something stupid.
Lucy frowned. “For what?”
“For calming me with a kiss”. He laughed when he saw her embarrassed blush. He moved forward and before she could think, he dropped a kiss on her cheek and left the gym.

**********
Teju tried to push her own heartache aside in order to help her friend out. The more she tried, the harder it became for her to understand. She had been with that ingrate for more than two years and when it was a few months to their wedding, he chickened out because of a cheap ass? She could not believe that a man could be so callous. In fact, all men are callous and wicked, she thought.
She gathered her thoughts and concentrated on the issue at hand. She knew that Luciana was Ok but still had no links to her. Not a day passed without her uttering a word of prayer for everyone involved in the struggle – Lucy, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, Deolu and all friends and family members involved.
‘That Fred is in Abuja and Inspector Chris has not given us any feedback’ she thought. It has been over two weeks now and there was still no response at all from the station. She wondered why police men were so useless; the only time they are useful is where bribery is involved. Could she blame them? The present government did not care whether the people ate or starved and the people have taken it upon themselves to do whatever they could for money.
When she had gone to the police station where Deolu was initially kept unlawfully weeks back, she had known that she would get vital information. She had interrogated the officers who carried out the job and found out the truth after much threat. She had given them the option of either winding up in jail or being her informants. Apparently, the latter option was chosen and she was glad that she had been wise enough. They were the ones who told her that Fred was in Abuja and now, after due research, it has already been discovered that the police in Abuja were doing next to nothing. No wanted banners or anything that can put Fred on the run. She smelled a rat and she was going to get to the root of it.
**********
**********
Tinuke sat on a stool in the kitchen as she waited for her food to cook. She shook her head as she remembered the humiliation that Teju had given her. She could not imagine why she had been so quiet. Even though she had the strong urge to slap Teju’s face, she hadn’t been able to dare it. Somehow, she feared Teju. Before she even met Teju, she had seen her pictures on Tunde’s phone and discovered that she was a barrister. She always feared people with the long graduants’ gown and a wig on their heads.
She had called herself Oyin when she met Tunde. She met him at the boutique, where she had gone to shop, in order to forget her sorrows. Tunde was a fine guy and she needed a distraction so she introduced herself as Oyin and the fun began. She hadn’t seen a guy who could resist her body and Tunde was not an exemption. Virtually everything she told Tunde about herself were lies and the fool believed every word that came out of her lips. She had enjoyed everything until she became bored. Tunde did not have enough cash to fit into Tinuke’s type of man. Raymond was everything. Ray had the killer looks that would intimidate any guy, he had the cash, he had the fame and also had the romantic instincts. She needed her man back. She was done playing ‘Oyin’ with Tunde. She wanted her man back. Teju was right; she needed to redefine herself.
**********
**********
Raymond swallowed as he entered his room. Too many things had happened too fast and he was entirely at fault. He could have simply told Lucy that he could not open that room for her but he had put up the brave front and had made it worse by entering the room. He sighed as he thought about his loss of composure. He felt so ashamed of himself. He had lost control in front of her and now she must be thinking that he was a weakling. He hadn’t been able to control himself until Lucy kissed him. That kiss was all he needed to come back to his senses.
She had been staying in his house for almost three weeks and everyday, his desire to kiss her and hold her against him increased. He had ensured that he kept his distance from her because he did not want to be seen as taking advantage of her because he helped her. It had been extremely difficult, judging by the way she constantly clouded his senses. He thought of her every time, even when he was busy at work. He would never have tried anything with her but something already happened – a kiss.
When he was in the gym, he barely noticed her presence because all he could see were the events that gave him constant nightmares. He had been certain that he was no longer sane because all his efforts to shut out the mental pictures had failed, but when Lucy had kissed him, he knew it was her. Within that second, all his fears and ghosts vanished and he could feel her. Lucy had made the act look like something irrelevant but he knew that it was not just a ‘calming kiss’ like she had called it. It might be for her but it was far much more than that to him. He could smell her, he could taste her, he could…
“Oh no” he groaned. “What am I doing?” he removed all his clothes in a flash and rushed to the bathroom. When he drove Tinuke away, he had promised himself that he would stay away from the opposite sex. His permanent break-up with Tinuke was not even a month old and he was already daydreaming about another girl. It made him wonder if he had actually loved Tinuke. Not that he loved Luciana but…
He jumped out of the shower and decided he needed fresh air. He wore something light and left the house, zooming off like someone was on his tail.
**********
**********
Deolu sat on the couch in Teju’s sitting room. She emerged with two glass cups and a pack of juice and filled them, taking one. Deolu took his and sipped.
“Teju” Deolu looked at her with a touch of concern. “I still feel there is something wrong that you are not telling me about. You look sad and hurt”
Teju stared at him. “Why won’t I be sad? Everyone is sad. It is my best friend that is missing here. Anyways, the main reason why I called you here is to find out some things.” She paused to sip her drink before she set it aside. “That DPO you met in Abuja… erm… Chris Chuks, tell me about him”.
“I know nothing about the man. When I got there, I expected to see Frank, my friend, but I saw Chris instead. I called Frank two days ago to help with the case and he told me that he had been transferred.”
“But he is still in Abuja?”
“Yes” he answered.
She adjusted thoughtfully. “I don’t trust that Chris.” An idea struck her and she rushed into the room to get her laptop. Deolu just looked at her, wandering why lawyers made a fuss over little things. The DPO was just not competent enough, that’s all.
Teju launched the browser on her laptop. “When you talked to him about the case, did you notice any discomfort or tension in him”.
“Of course not. He only listened the way any other DPO would.” He answered instantly.
Teju stared at him as she waited for the information she sought to fully load. “Are you a hundred percent sure? Lucy is on the line remember? I just have a strong conviction and I need to be sure”
The mention of Luciana’s name did the trick. “Yes!” Deolu exclaimed. “It was when I gave him the pictures of Lucy and Fred. He was practically shocked. When I querried him, he gave me a flimsy excuse”
Teju nodded distractedly as she opened the data on her laptop. It was Chris Chuks’ biography. When she read a few lines, she nodded. “I knew it”
“Knew what?” Deolu sat beside her now, reading from the laptop.
“He is from Imo state”
“And what has that got to do with this issue?”
Teju wished that she had a lawyer beside her who would understand many things without being told. “Apparently, I heard Fred tell Lucy that he has a brother in Abuja whose name is Chris. That could easily pass for a coincidence but it can’t be a coincidence that they are both from the same state, can it?”
“Oh my God! That filthy bastard.” Deolu cursed as he rose to his feet. “I should have known”.
Teju relaxed and smiled at the situation and Deolu looked at her with a puzzled expression. She stared at him as if surprised that he could not even decipher what she was thinking. “Fred is in Abuja, meaning, his hideout is more than likely known by Chris. We don’t know where Fred is but we know where Chris is”.
“So, if we can get Chris, we would know where Fred is” he finished and Teju smiled. Deolu smiled wholeheartedly for the first time in days. It can be really wonderful having a lawyer as a friend.
**********
**********
Raymond got back home when it was already dark. He had driven round and finally branched to greet one of his friends. They had talked and talked till it was dark. As he locked the door of his car, he entered the house with only one thing in mind – sleep. He called Lucy but no answer came. He could not imagine her asleep at that time; it was not 8 o’clock yet. He called and called but did not get any answer. He went to her room and knocked but no answer came. After some time, he opened the door and he met the room empty. Panic was the first thing that arose in him. He checked everywhere in the room but did not see her. He ran out to question his gateman but saw a note on the side table in the sitting room.
“Hello Raymond,
Words cannot express how grateful I am that people like you exist. You picked me up and took care of me, risking everything. I am alive today because of God and you. Please don’t be sad that I had to leave like this. I figured that if I don’t leave now, I would not want to leave anymore. You made me feel at home in your house. Thank you. I needed to leave because my absence at home would be creating confusion, just as my presence in your house is creating confusion. I need to find a solution to the problem I am in and staying in your place is not making me do anything about it. My people are running around in circles and it is hurting me.
Please do me a favour. I need you to accept the past. You are strong and compassionate and that is why the death of your parents affected you this much but you have to let it go. I never loved art but I have never seen anything more beautiful than the paintings I saw today. You don’t have to forget your past, you just have to accept it because your past can make you a better and stronger person. Painting brings you fulfillment and it would hurt to see you give up what you love doing. God loves you. Don’t stay angry at God because he does not make mistakes. He gives, he takes. The same way you have the power to do anything you like with your paintings is the same way God has the power to do what he wants to do with us. It was not your parents that got burnt in that crash but their flesh. When we get to heaven, we would see them without a single scratch. Your parents would be very happy where they are if you keep on holding on to God like they wanted you to.
Please greet Vicky and tell her that I would miss her terribly. She is always in my heart and my prayers. Wish she was my sister. I would miss you a lot Ray and the nicknames you call me.
With Love
Sug ar”
The paper slipped out of Ray’s fingers as he stared into space.

Mr and Mrs Jones sat on the chair. They had just finished parading another set of hospitals but they got no good news as usual. Some people had advised them to check the mortuaries but they rejected it saying it was not their portion to bury their daughter. Bewaji called her maid to bring a glass of water for her. She dropped her head on Ken’s shoulders and he held her. They heard a knock and Bewaji stood up to answer it since the maid was in the kitchen.
Immediately she opened the door, she let out a scream that brought Ken to her side in a flash.

_EPISODE 23_

Luciana jumped inside the house and slammed the door before they attracted the neighbors. She removed the shawl she had used in covering her face and dropped it carelessly on the floor. Her heart beat wildly as she stared at her parents. They both looked lean and fagged from excessive worry.
Tears slipped Bewaji’s eyes as she stared at her daughter. “Lucy” she whispered. “Lucy, is that you?” Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. She held Ken’s shirt with her eyes glued to Lucy, “Am I dreaming Ken?”
Lucy’s father was as dumbstruck as Lucy who also stood with her eyes glistening with tears.
“Mum” she managed to say and rushed into her mother’s arms. “It is me mum” she shook. “It is Luciana”.
Bewaji held her daughter as she sobbed. “My baby… my baby is back” she murmured as she clung to Lucy. “Oh my God!” Bewaji pulled back, kissed Luciana’s face and forehead several times and pulled her back into her embrace. She held on to her like a lifeline as she murmured everything that came to her head.
“It is OK mum. You are going to make me cry” But she was already crying. Seeing her parents overwhelmed her beyond her expectations. She pulled back and turned to her dad. He stood with a loving smile on his face. His swimming eyes nearly undid her as she ran into his hands.
“Oh daddy” she cried.
“I have missed you my girl” he said, controlled now but with emotions that shook her. He brushed his fingers through her hair, like he was trying to memorize or recall the texture. “You almost sent us to an early grave with worry pumpkin, don’t ever do this again” His tone was very light.
Lucy pulled back slightly. “I won’t dad, I am sorry” she hugged her dad again. She had missed him terribly.
“C’mon ken, don’t scold my baby now. She just arrived” Bewaji said, holding both of them. Now, she felt complete.
“Ah aunty”
Everyone turned and Lucy saw the maid. “Oh Dana, come and give me a hug. I have missed you”
Dana rushed into Lucy’s arms and held her like a vise. When they pulled apart, Dana fidgeted slightly. “Aunty, I was very worried about you o. I prayed everyday that you would come back safely” she said, looking at her fingers.
Lucy smiled. “And the prayers are answered.” She felt truly blessed to have people who love her around her.
“Yes, she was so worried. We all were. I almost died” Bewaji smiled and held her daughter’s hand with the fear that she might vanish again.
“Come and sit down pumpkin, you must be really tired” Ken said as they moved to the room. “Tell me everything. I want to hear every detail of what actually happened.”
“It is a long story. Dad, can you please call Teju and Deolu. I need to put them out of this trauma, and even though I really would like to make my presence public, I feel it might be risky. Please don’t tell them that I am here dad. They might get over-excited, especially Deolu, and we don’t want that”.
“Right away” he said, grabbing his phone.
Bewaji was busy inspecting Luciana’s body for marks and the like. She pulled her into her arms and held on to her.
**********
**********
Teju packed a few things inside her extra large hand bag. It is not a myth that the handbag of a lady could very well take in everything that she needs for a week. Teju would be travelling to Abuja the following day. She had decided that going to Abuja would be very effective, instead of Deolu because she would be able to use her expertise as a lawyer to attend to matters. She had previously thought of following the DPO secretly in order to get Fred’s whereabouts but later decided that the method would not be effective. The DPO might suspect something and their plans would be blown to the wind. Chris might not even go there at all or early enough. Blackmail seemed the best tool to use in a case like this. She knew just the right words to use in order to get results.
Teju heard her phone ring and picked it up from the bed. She was not surprised that it was Lucy’s dad. They communicated frequently, especially since the disappearance of Lucy. She just wished she could tell them that their daughter was alright.
“Good afternoon sir” she said immediately she answered the call.
“Hello dear, how are you today?” Mr. Jones replied in the receiver.
“I am fine sir” She noted certain calmness in his voice with surprise and happiness.
“That is good. Can you come over to the house? There is something we would like to show you”
“Something?” Teju became very curious.
“Yes. It is a bit urgent”
He did not sound urgent; Teju mused but shrugged it off. She just hoped it had to do with Lucy’s case. “Yes sir. I would be there in a jiffy”.
**********
**********
It had been long since Deolu sat in his office but even as he sat there, his heart and brain was far away. He was terribly worried about Lucy. Just that morning, he had called so many hospitals again, just as he did every day to make enquiries but as usual, it proved abortive. A friend of his had commented that the guy might have thrown her into the lagoon but had rejected it vehemently, nearly beating up his friend in the process. Times spent with Teju had eased his pain. He realized that whenever he was with Teju, he worried less. She seemed to take away his problems and pains with her lawyer attitudes. He still could not pinpoint why he felt she was in pains. Something had changed about her. She was not as lively as before, even though you would barely notice the changes if you were not careful enough. She had always remained positive and optimistic about Lucy’s return, using the stubborn attitude of being a lawyer to her advantage. She was not ready to accept defeat and he liked that about her. That trait was also very visible in Lucy although, gentler. They were truly birds of a feather.
Deolu’s phone rang, saving him from his thoughts. He smiled when he saw the caller.
“Hello sir”
“How are you son?” Mr. Jones responded over the phone.
“I am fine sir. Hope you are feeling better sir”
“Yes. Glory to God. I wonder if you can come over to my house now; there is something I would like to show you”
Deolu was happy that something was taking him out of his office. He hadn’t done any meaningful thing there. “Right away sir…”
**********
**********
Ray had never been so helpless in his life. His life felt empty and it scared him. He felt like something had left him. He felt his life was just as empty as his house was. He changed from one channel of the television to the other but nothing came close to appealing to his senses. Just some time ago, he was telling himself that it would be best if she left and now that that thought had come to a reality, he felt miserable. ‘Be careful what you wish for, you just might have it’. That sentence echoed in his brain as he walked helplessly towards the refrigerator for a pack of juice. He cared less if there was food because he had no appetite at all.
As he drank Chivita, he stared at the television screen, seeing only the pictures in his head. He wondered where Lucy was, if she was safe, if she was hungry. He stood and paced. He felt miserably helpless and he could not understand why he felt that way. She was just his guest, nothing more. He had helped in saving her life but he did not see himself as a super star that was able to save a damsel in distress, he felt lucky instead that he had been able to do something for her. God had used him for her; He could as well have used someone else. God? He could not believe he had thought of God using him. He swallowed when the content of the letter replayed itself in his head. He dropped his glass and went out of the house to discuss with his gateman. He was very glad then that he had employed a gateman.
**********
**********
Lucy tried not to engage the thoughts that were trying to cloud her head. She was very happy to be home but she felt something was wrong. She felt incomplete. It was just a silent feeling which she easily overlooked as she laughed and smiled to everything that was being said. Her parents were fussing over her and she felt like a one year old again. The knock at the door interrupted their reunion and Luciana’s heart skipped wildly. She wondered which one of the two had arrived. Dana was a bit reluctant to leave Lucy’s side but she did anyways.
The voice Luciana heard made her smile widely and she was up instantly. Teju moved into the sitting room and it took a while before her brain could take in what she was seeing. She froze for some seconds as she gaped at Lucy who stood grinning.
“Lucy… Ahhhhh” she screamed as they both ran into each other’s arms. Lucy’s parents were laughing at the scene. Teju moved slightly away and started inspecting Lucy’s body as if she was checking if her body parts were complete. “Oh Lucy” she hugged her again.
“T.J… I have missed your troublesome self o” Lucy said and laughed as she blinked back the tears that came to her eyes.
“Yes. You must miss me. I have also missed the coconut rice you always cook for me” they both laughed. Teju was trying to control herself and not cry like a baby. She had missed her best friend.
As the two friends fussed over each other, they were so engulfed in their excitement that they did not hear the knock on the door. When the door opened, Lucy turned and froze when she stared at Deolu.
Deolu stood at the entrance as his eyes took in the image before him. Even when he came to fully acknowledge the fact that he was not dreaming, he still could not move a muscle. All the times that he had imagined Lucy’s return, he had imagined carrying her, kissing her until his lips ached and so many things but he never imagined that he would just stand at the entrance and stare. Life seemed to have departed his legs and he could not move them.
Lucy walked slowly towards him, feeling a quiet panic within her. Raymond flashed through her mind and she pushed away the image. She stood right in front of Deolu and watched him swallow forcefully. “Lucy” he called as if he wanted to be double sure that he was not seeing things. She answered by moving into his arms.
“Oh God” he breathed as he wrapped his arms around her. His hands shook as he held on to her like his life depended on it. He breathed in the scent of her hair as he held her. “My love… oh my love” he murmured. “Life has been miserable since you vanished.”
“I am sorry for putting you through all these” she said, still in his arms. Deolu pulled her back and kissed her forehead, her cheeks and lips. Ken coughed audibly as he fisted his arms. Deolu held on to Lucy without letting her go and Bewaji put her hand on her husband’s shoulder to calm him.
“Why don’t we move this love scene to the sitting room” Bewaji said, moving towards the couple.
Several minutes after, everyone was seated in the sitting room. Lucy sat at the middle of Teju and Deolu and he held her to him with her head resting on his shoulders. With everyone being attentive, she narrated everything that happened, although carefully edited. She told them how Fred had stabbed her because of jealousy and had dumped her thinking that she was dead. How she had been rescued by Raymond and admitted in the hospital where she spent over three weeks. How she had spent some days in Raymond’s house in order to fully recuperate.
Ken was already pacing when she finished. “That filthy son of the devil” he swore. Bewaji was almost in tears at the thought of what her daughter had gone through and she said that she would like to meet Raymond. “That guy is our saving grace” she said. Deolu was furious, just like Ken. Teju just sat and stared, calculating like the lawyer she was.
Lucy’s stomach grumbled and she remembered that she had not eaten anything. She had skipped breakfast at Ray’s place when there was no one to eat with. “Please can I get something to eat? I am starving” she complained. Everyone swung to action like she was the first lady. She wanted to go to the kitchen herself but she was denied.
Food was presented in no time and she dug into the food. Everyone watched her as she ate, knowing that her being alive was a miracle. Watching her eat brought pleasure to them all.

_EPISODE 24_

After Luciana had eaten, they had allowed her take a nap in order to rest and relax more. Luciana had fallen into a dreamless sleep and woke up almost two hours later. The first person she saw when she opened her eyes was her mum. Bewaji seemed to derive pleasure from watching her daughter sleep; in fact, she derived pleasure in watching everything Luciana did.
Lucy smiled down at her mother with sleepy eyes. “Relax mum, I am not going anywhere”.
Bewaji smiled. “It would take a few days to make me believe it baby”
Lucy nodded. “I missed you mum, so much” she sat up.
“Me too dear. I told you that leaving this house was a bad idea but you never listen. You are just as stubborn as your father”
“Don’t go there mum. I left for work, besides, I like it there. I love the work. Mum, I think it is best I talked with everyone about the situation on ground. The guy is still freely roaming the streets” she changed the subject.
Luciana got to the sitting room and found everyone waiting there, having a little chatter. Their eyes followed her to her seat, making her feel awkward, with her legs hitting themselves. “Can you guys stop staring? You are making me feel weird” she stated exasperatedly.
Teju laughed. “We are still surprised that you are here babe”.
“Get used to it”
“I am used to it already. Now, let’s get down to business” she transformed to a lawyer within the twinkling of an eye and Lucy smiled. “I have my luggage packed for Abuja tomorrow. I should be able to lay my hands on the murderer.”
“Fred is not a murderer, he was just blinded with jealousy-” everyone in the room stared at Lucy like she had lost her mind. “Besides, Teju, you can’t go looking for a ‘murderer’ in Abuja. He is a man and you are a woman; a fragile one at that”
“Oh… give me a break Lucy. It was your mummy attitude I missed a lot. I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I am a barrister for heaven’s sake” Teju retorted.
“Lucy is right” Deolu stated. “It is risky having you there alone. I am coming with you”.
“Obviously not. I am not going to be all alone, that policeman Deolu told me about would be helping me out. Besides, you need Deolu here now.” She replied.
“No” Luciana said immediately. She softened. “Listen Teju, I would hate myself forever if anything happened to any of you because of me; you especially. Let Deolu go with you. He is a man and he can take care of you and himself” Lucy concluded.
“I want to go and see the face of that scoundrel and teach him a lesson he would not forget in a hurry” Ken dropped with finality in his tone.
“You would do no such thing” Bewaji said glaring at him.
Teju looked at the whole scenario and laughed. “Well, this is cozy. Since my over-protective sister does not want me alone, I would go with Deolu. His numerous connections should come in handy. Dad, I am afraid your presence there would be more harm than good”.
Ken growled. Women and their easy ways of twisting themselves around your neck until you had no choice but to succumb to their will. He swallowed.
Teju thought of how to drop what had popped into her mind during the course of the argument. She knew it would not be taken well. “There is a little problem though”. When she had all their attention, she continued. “There is no evidence. When we find Fred, which I am sure we will, there would still be no evidence to ensure he gets the punishments for his crimes. If he gets a good lawyer in court, he might even coin his way out without a scratch”
“What other evidence is required? My daughter here is enough testimony”. Ken said and Bewaji nodded her head vigorously.
“No sir, the law does not work like that. We need proof. If only we could make Fred assume that Lucy is dead…”
“What?” Deolu yelled and Ken sat with his eyes wide open. Lucy seemed to have frozen on her seat.
“God forbid” Bewaji yelled. “Listen, I am not in for all this ridiculous nonsense you lawyers put yourselves into.”
“Please understand me. If Fred is made to believe that Lucy is dead, we can get some evidence from him. After his mind must have settled on the fact that she is dead, Lucy can now appear to him like a ghost and he would spill the beans, while we record secretly; just like what we see in the movies”.
Lucy laughed slightly. “I have always imagined myself as an actress. When do we get to act this movie?”
Bewaji turned glaring eyes at Lucy and she flinched.
“You want me to announce the death of my daughter when she is still alive?” Ken asked, stupefied.
“And would remain alive for a long long time” Bewaji added.
Teju was speechless; she also could not believe that she was uttering such jargons, even though she knew the stunt would be helpful.
“But I understand what you are trying to say” Ken said thoughtfully and Bewaji turned to glare at him. “It does not have to be made public. We can just get someone to print it out in something that would definitely pass for a colorless newspaper. Add other irrelevant stories. It can just be a piece of the newspaper, a fake newspaper at that. You can slut it in your bag and show them. They would be so concerned about the story in the paper that they would not even think about the authenticity of the story. Besides, that is the news Fred is expecting. He already imagines her dead; we just need to fuel his conviction”.
“You think and talk like a lawyer sir” Teju grinned.
Ken shrugged. “Well, I always knew I could succeed in that profession but unfortunately, I went for engineering.”
“You would beat the experts in the field also”
“Ken” Bewaji yelled, with her eyes popping.
“Mum, it is ok. As long as this can keep Fred locked up in the cell, I am down with it. I should enjoy the acting”.
Teju noticed Lucy’s emphasis on Fred’s being locked up and it struck her as odd. The Lucy she knew would even intercede and plead on the behalf of even a murderer. Even though she would like to believe that the reason for Lucy’s action was because the person that this murderer had attempted killing was her own self, she knew that there was more to it than meets the eye. She had noticed the way Lucy carefully picked her words when she had explained what happened to her earlier on. She looked at Lucy and wondered what Fred had actually done to her.
**********
**********
Deolu and Teju walked into a hotel the following evening. They had left Lagos later than they ought to because they needed that newspaper, even though it was only a spreadsheet. Deolu had booked a flight for both of them and they were in Abuja earlier than expected.
“We need two rooms, very close to each other.” Deolu smiled at the receptionist. Teju rolled her eyes as she watched the receptionist flirt with Deolu. She almost hissed out of annoyance. That is the way ladies bring themselves low and end up becoming a ‘use and dump’ for guys. She mused. The lady gave Deolu the two keys and he gave her some money with some extra naira notes for herself. She thanked him immensely and her praises followed them as they walked away from the reception.
“Do you have to do that?”
“Do what?” Deolu returned.
“Tip everyone you see. Money should be spent carefully. The fact that you have excess money does not mean that you should spend it lavishly”
Deolu smiled. “I don’t tip everyone I see, only those that I feel like. It is good to give people money, especially people who are in need of it. You don’t know who might be of help to you tomorrow”.
“I give alms to the needy, I am not saying it is wrong, only that you should be careful to not overdo it”. She replied.
“Yes ma” he gave a mock bow.
Their rooms were opposite each other, so they both went to their rooms to freshen up and relax. Barely thirty minutes after, Teju knocked on Deolu’s door. He had just finished putting on a casual cloth after taking a shower. He would have relaxed a bit on the bed if Teju hadn’t knocked. When he opened the door, he noticed she was still in the clothes she had on before.
“Come inside Teju. Thought I should give you some time to relax before we get dinner” he said as he ushered her in.
She laughed slightly. “There is no time to waste. I need to survey my surroundings and get some things to work on tonight, so that I can have a solid ground to work on tomorrow”.
Deolu stared at her. “This is past six Teju, it is almost dark. Everything can wait till tomorrow.”
“No.” Teju shook her head with a calm smile.
Deolu looked at her for some seconds and exhaled. “Sit” he ordered. Teju wanted to argue but the tone of his voice told her that there would be no room for arguments.
Seated, she faced Deolu on the chair. “I am seated. What is it?”
“Teju, I have known you for some time now and I think I know you to a certain extent. The recent problems have brought us together more and I have been able to see a part of you that I never saw before. You changed recently. You have become quiet and distant. You have also turned to a workaholic. Something is wrong. Can you tell me?”
Teju paused and looked on. “What makes you think something is wrong? Lucy-”
“Don’t give me that fake story, Teju. I know you are hurting, someone hurt you badly but I don’t know who. Is it your fiancé?”
Teju’s head snapped. “No” she stood up immediately but Deolu held her hand back.
“Be honest with me T, let it out. What did he do?” he probed, getting up too but keeping his voice calm and soothing.
“He dumped me six months and five days to our wedding for a harlot, that’s what he did”. She snatched her hand from his and flew out of the room.
**********
**********
Lucy lay on the bed as her mind wandered away. She swallowed as various unwanted thoughts clouded her brain. She wondered if it was possible to sleep without thinking.
“Luciana” Bewaji called and she jerked out of her thoughts. She was not aware of the door opening.
“Hey mum, you are not asleep yet?”
Bewaji smiled. “No. I feel we need to go and thank the Good Samaritan that helped you. You surely know the place. That guy was used by God to save your life.”
Lucy’s heart skipped severally. “You know mum that I ought to lay low for now. We don’t want someone to pass information to Fred that he or she saw me. You know, we had been friends for a long time and most of his friends know me”.
“That filthy thing” Bewaji swore. “Although, you could write the address of that Raymond so that we can go there without you. I would never be at rest until I appreciate that guy for the great thing he did for me. Your dad and I would go; you would stay here with Dana” she concluded.
Lucy swallowed hard. “Ok mum”

_EPISODE 25_

Deolu knocked on Teju’s door the next day. He hadn’t been able to get her to open the door the previous day and he had called for dinner to be sent to her room. He was already dressed for the day ahead and he wondered if Teju was awake yet. He wanted to confirm what she would take for breakfast so they could eat together and possibly talk about her heartbreak.
The door opened and Teju stood before him – fully dressed. “You are awake?” he managed to murmur.
“Obviously” she grinned. “Good morning Dee” she looked him over with the same grin on her face.
“Lemon looks good on you Teju, so much” Deolu said with an appreciative look in his eyes.
“Anything would look good on me” she dropped.
“Obviously” Deolu mimicked and Teju smiled. “Why do I feel that you are dressed to seduce?” He raised his eyebrow.
Teju feigned a look of innocence. “Can’t say I know what you are talking about” the look he gave her forced her to drop the pretense. “Alright, fine. Looking good and appealing is part of my tactic today. No one refuses a beautiful lady anything, thanks to God, I have a lot of beauty at my disposal”. She landed and Deolu grinned.
“Won’t you invite me in?”
Teju opened the door wide enough for him to enter. As he entered, she grinned again mischievously and Deolu became nervous. “Spill it” he dropped.
Teju laughed. “I never knew that you could dress so erm… so normally.”
He blanched. “Normal” he repeated.
“Yes. I mean, no suit and tie that makes you look like a pastor or a banker. You look like a guy in this outfit of jeans and T shirt” she said, tongue in cheek.
“Wow… I never knew that the suit made me look so cheesy and serious”
She laughed. “Not so serious. They all look good on you. You won’t be Luciana’s guy if you were anything less” she grinned.
He cleared his throat, sitting down. “Thought she didn’t care about the physical appearance”.
“All ladies do. We like to show off our man” she picked up her shoes and started putting them on.
He saw the tray on the table. “You have eaten?”
“Yeah. Had to do so in order for me to get to business early enough” she was done with her shoes.
“Can we talk”
Teju glanced at him, and without even looking, she knew what was coming. “Maybe when I come back; time is against me”
He frowned. “We are going together”
She shook her head. “No Dee. I have to do this on my own. You people did not understand me when I talked then. It won’t work well if they see you there now. They don’t know me, especially the DPO who is our target. It would be easier for me being a lawyer and I don’t want you to ruin everything with your presence. Don’t get me wrong, the DPO might see you afar off and flee. That is what I am against”. She smiled at him. “I can take care of myself, you don’t have to bodyguard me”.
“I would love to take you up on that but-”
“But I am late. The earlier the better” she concluded. Deolu knew he would get nowhere by arguing with her. He would get her later, but for now, she needed to have her way. He stood up as his tummy grumbled for attention. “Guess I would be eating alone then. Be careful” he murmured when he got to the door.
She smiled as she lifted her bag. “No mortal can do anything to Teju except God allows it”. She smiled at her own words, remembering Tunde and the fact that she had not yet accepted that his leaving her was God’s will.
**********
**********
“I can’t believe she is gone” Vicky murmured as she sat on the couch facing Raymond. She had just arrived from her friend’s place and after dropping her things, she discovered that Lucy was not in. Raymond broke the news of her departure to her.
“The earlier you believe it, the better for you” Ray’s eyes were fixed on the flat screen TV.
She sighed. “I must have scared her off; and to think I imagined that she accepted me for who I am… should have known that no one can” she was sober.
“What are you talking about” Ray’s attention turned to her instantly.
“I told her about my sexuality”
“You did what?” Raymond yelled as he jumped to his feet. “What were you thinking? Were you daft or something”
“I was perfectly ok. Just did not want someone to like me and later become disappointed when they find out the truth”
Ray did not know why he yelled that way but he was furious. He had been the only one in their family to accept Vicky unconditionally even though her acts irritated him terribly. “When did you tell her?”
“The day after I arrived”
Ray looked at her like she had gone mad but he held his tongue. He wondered why he did not see the trace of hate in Lucy towards Vicky. Not everyone would accept a lesbian that easily except if they believed in them, which he found ridiculous. “Well, she left for her family. She even said in her letter that she wished you guys were sisters”. Vicky was stunned but she did not have the opportunity to probe him further because they heard the gate open and Ray knew who to expect.
He opened the door and met Duke who was walking majestically towards him. The guy could be a charmer any time any day without even trying.
“Hey man” he greeted Duke with a smile and they gave themselves the usual manly hug. “To what do I owe the honour?”
“Is it a crime to visit my best friend?”
“Judging by the last time you visited me, I would bet this year’s salary that you are not here specifically for me”
“I would be ready to take that bet anytime” he grinned. They entered the sitting room and Vicky who had been watching a movie turned round. Duke’s heart skipped a beat as he stared at the only woman he had ever loved. He had fallen in love with her long ago but when he bore his heart to her, she had in turn told him that she saw him as someone of the same sex with her and the only people that appealed to her were females. Being in love with a lesbian was the last thing he ever imagined would happen to him. The incident would have affected his relationship with Raymond but he did not allow it. It took a long time for him to forget her even though she was already out of the country.
Vicky swallowed and smiled tightly at Duke. If she had known that he would be visiting, she would have stayed back at her friend’s place, besides, she was also a lesbian.
“Hello Vic” Duke finally broke the silence. Ray just stood still, watching the drama. “I can see that you are still as sexy as ever” his eyes roamed Vicky and Raymond frowned protectively.
“And you are even more of a flirt” Vicky replied with a corny smile.
“Amen to that” Duke’s eyes held no smile even though his smile portrayed them.
“OK” Ray cut in. “Vicky, could you please get us juice?”
Vicky left without a reply and Ray fixed Duke a warning glare. As they sat, Ray faced Duke. “I think I am ready for that bet now” Duke hissed and he laughed.
**********
**********
Lucy washed the dishes and her mum kept on pestering her. She wondered why the questions her mum was asking were affecting her comfort; but she knew. She knew why she felt uncomfortable.
“Answer me Lucy, I am your mum. You should not be shy to tell me about your love life. Knowing how long you stayed without a single boy in your life, I bet Deolu did what all those guys could not do. Tell me, how did you meet?” Bewaji glued herself to the side of the zinc, grinning like a teenager.
Luciana sighed. “Work brought us together mum. We needed a supply of some furniture and I had to meet with Deolu for negotiation.”
Bewaji smiled. “At least something good came out of that job. Now I am happy that you took the job because if you did not, you would probably remain single forever. Tell me: was it love at first sight or did it grow on you?”
Luciana’s stomach turned so much that she felt she might throw up. She became whiter than she already was but Bewaji mistook her reaction for embarrassment. Luckily for Lucy, Bewaji’s phone rang and she went for it, leaving her to breathe in a free air again.
**********
**********
Teju walked stylishly into the police station with a faint and feminine smile on her face. She saw the way the policemen had their eyes on her with every step she took. Deolu had been right. The dress made her feel feminine and in control.
She got to the counter. “Good morning, please I am here to see the DPO” she said with an irresistible smile on her face. The three policemen were grinning foolishly and she felt the urge to punch them in the face.
“I would give anything to be the reason for your visit” the one facing her said.
She half laughed. “You won’t betray your DPO now, would you? Even if you are this handsome” she could not believe her own words.
Another policeman pushed the other away. “What? I am more handsome” he grinned.
Teju laughed. “Sure. You all are. Now I want to see your DPO, when I am through, I would see you guys”.
They all smiled. “You dey lucky say e dey office” the last one said in pidgin and Teju wondered if his earlier silence was because he could not speak proper English. He left for the DPO’s office after asking of her name while Teju continued chatting with the other two.
“You fit go inside”
Teju thanked him with a smile and walked to the office, knocking slightly before entering.
“Hello DPO… Mr. Chuks?”
“Yes. Please have your seat.” His eyes lit with appreciation at her beauty and she smiled internally. After she was seated, she placed her small purse on the table. “Please, I don’t know you; how may I help you?”
“The question should be: how may ‘I’ help you” she countered.
Chris frowned. “I don’t understand lady”
Teju smiled menacingly. “Let’s just say I have the power to destroy you” Chris gasped. “The power to break you and shatter all you have ever worked for”.
Chris composed himself. “Are you here to threaten me?”
Teju’s smile did not leave its place. “I am not here to threaten. I am here to assure you of what I would do”. When she saw that a certain level of fear had been implanted, she slowly picked her purse and opened. “I have something that would interest you” she took out the carefully folded newspaper, opened it and gave it to the DPO. His hands and eyes froze when she stared at the same girl she had seen in the picture given to him by Deolu. The truth was already out, he knew it. “What… what… what is… this? And who the hell are you” he yelled as his palms began to sweat.
Teju deliberately took out the smile on her face slowly, leaving her face serious and blank. “That signified that Luciana was murdered and I am Barrister Teju Bello, Deolu’s lawyer” she dropped.
Chris’ mouth fell open as he tried to gather what was happening to him. His life was now completely ruined. He would be behind bars, all for helping that Fred. His wife… his two daughters… he could not imagine it.
Teju smiled and got up slowly, roaming the office slowly. “When Deolu had told me that no move was taken in Abuja concerning the search of the murderer, I decided to dig. I wondered which DPO would be at peace knowing that a murderer was roaming the FCT of Nigeria. Then I discovered the reason: he knows, or should I say well acquainted with the murderer.” She faced him as his eyes watered. “How would you love to be charged for treason sir? You know, you could as well be his accomplice.”
“No ma’am. Please for God’s sake. I did not do anything, please. My children are still very small, please” he begged, getting up.
“I know you are a good man, just don’t know why you are protecting this murderer. He murdered that innocent girl in cold blood, what makes you think he can’t do the same with you or your children? Listen, I would give you the chance to right this mistake. Produce Fred and I would not press any charges against you. My client does not know about your betrayal but believe me; he would not hesitate to ruin your life and career if he found out that you are in any way connected with Fred. The guy killed his fiancée!” she exclaimed as fury sliced through her. “You have 24 hours to think about it” she dropped a tiny card on the table and picked up the newspaper which had fallen carelessly out of Chris’ hands. “Give me a call when you have made up your mind and don’t think of doing anything foolish. You don’t want to mess with Teju Bello, believe me” her eyes held meaning as they burned fire. She straightened and smiled mischievously. “Have a nice day” she walked quietly out of the office, leaving Chris shaken.

_EPISODE 26_

Duke and Raymond discussed unhindered in the sitting room. Raymond was trying his possible best to use his best friend as a tool in order to forget his worries and keep his head straight. Never did a minute pass when he did not think about Luciana, worrying if she was alright. Being in the office made it worse; he was being paid to stay focused when he was doing the exact opposite. He could not remember anyone who took over his thoughts the way Luciana had done successfully. They were never intimate throughout their stay except for the kiss that in the gym. Even though he had been barely conscious, he still felt her soft lips on his and it had continuously haunted him until he felt he would run mad from desiring to really kiss her. The gym had become his favorite part of the house because he went there frequently to work of his stress and thoughts; even at that, there was little or no effect. He had no doubt in his mind that the kiss was what propelled Lucy’s speedy departure. He had known that she would leave soon but not as fast as a bullet.
“RAY” Duke yelled as he and Vicky stared at Raymond who suddenly bolted out of his reverie. The two pairs of eyes peering at him drew a scowl from him.
“What is it? Do you have to yell my name like that when we are two steps away from each other?” Ray asked as the anger that had become his best friend for the past few days began to erupt.
“Considering the fact that I have been calling and talking to you for minutes now with your mind being far away, I was sorely tempted to use a megaphone in retrieving your escaping mind” Duke ranted. “What the hell have you been thinking about?”
“I am sure a particular fair goddess with an incredibly long brown hair and striking eye balls has created a castle in his head. He was merely exploring it” Vicky said with a glint of humor in her eyes.
Duke frowned. “I never knew Raymond was that much into Tinuke. Especially with all her unbearable attitudes. Does she have brown hair?”
Vicky snorted. “Tinuke my foot. Even Tinuke cannot stand Lucy’s beauty. Ray has been testy ever since the rare beauty left, I have no doubt he is in love with her”
Duke smiled. “You don’t say” he had a devilish grin that Ray already recognized as a sign that he would continuously tease him until he said something. He hissed. Duke and Vicky kept on talking about him, like he was not present while he just looked on.
“Raymond is in love!” Duke exclaimed then out of the blues, he asked Vicky. “How did you know?”
She smiled. “You only need to see the way he looks at her. He stares at her even when she is not looking and the look on his face is priceless. She was able to pull him to the kitchen, can you believe that? He looks at her like she was the last icing on the cake and he would not wait to grab it for himself”
Ray snorted. “If I am correct, you used to think the same of Bose and I” he replied.
She smiled. “Yeah, I used to, because I mistook your likeness for her as love. The way you gazed at Lucy can never be compared to the way you looked at Bose. The chemistry between you and Lucy cannot be denied also; I am sure Lucy left because she could not withstand your powerful appeal. I noticed her efforts in ensuring you guys never stood too close to each other” she had this love signs in her eyes as she talked.
The analysis struck Duke as odd, coming from the mouth of Vicky. “And how would you know how a man looks at a woman he loves?”
Vicky turned to him as the humor in her eyes and voice evaporated. Ray noticed the turning table with both relief and anxiety.
“I don’t expect you to know that. The highest you should know is how a woman in love looks at another woman” Duke continued.
“Bring it down Duke” Raymond said quietly, knowing how hard it had been for Duke to forget Vicky.
“I know exactly what a man in love looks like…” Vicky felt insulted.
“Humor me” Duke countered.
Raymond stood up with a sigh and turned towards the entrance. He knew that they needed to settle their score so he decided to leave them alone. He had enough things to think about. When he got to the doorway, he faced the duo and smiled. “I guess you don’t need me here. Three is a crowd. Duke” he called. “Be a gentleman”.
“How can I be anything less? I would not dream of crossing the line with someone who considers herself a man, even though she dresses otherwise. Would rather be with that fat dwarf in the office”. Ray swallowed and left them alone while Vicky sat down, glaring. She was hurt by that sentence.
“So, you consider me unappealing” Vicky mouthed.
“It is your appeal that sickens me. I was crazily in love with you but what did you give me? You threw my love in my face, telling yourself the ridiculous story of being a lesbian”
“It is not a ridiculous story. I am a lesbian. Men do not appeal to me and it is not my fault that I am like this. I did not create myself”
“You were not made like this. The problem is that you have not found the guy to make you squirm”
“I am not interested in any search. I have searched and found no one but now I am comfortable with what I am” she glared and stood up as she became very angry. “The earlier you accept it, the better for you. I have not had anything to do with men for over a decade and I never will” she declared.
“I would be an exception” Duke grabbed her hand and pulled her to him, so fast that she did not even have enough time to breathe.
“What the hell is this?” she asked breathlessly.
“When I kiss you, I want you to know that it is Duke and not one of those whores” with that he brought down his lips to hers, kissing her thoroughly with anger. She struggled for some time against his chest but he pinned her to him until she later relaxed, knowing that no harm would come from letting him indulge himself. She was sure that he would have no effect on her.
When Duke sensed her total surrender, his anger seemed to evaporate and what was left was the love he had for her. He had been sure the feelings were dead but now they burned with rage, even higher than what he had felt for her five years ago. Even as he kissed her, he knew that he would suffer the consequences. He would have to deal with killing that feeling all over again but even at that, he just kissed her. When she placed her palm on his chest, a cold shiver went down his spine and he jerked away from her. She looked stunned but he just turned around and marched out of the house without looking back.
**********
*********
When Raymond left the main house, his intention was to go into the gym as he usually does but he found himself opening another door. Even as he stepped into the room, he could not believe that his legs had brought him there. There was a time when art was his life and he could hardly do without drawing or painting in a day. But he hadn’t lifted a paintbrush or a drawing pencil in years and he wondered if the gift was still there. He swallowed as he traced some of the paintings with his fingertips, drawing dust from them. He remembered with a smile that Lucy also traced them that way.
Raymond took calculated steps towards that stunning painting on the wall and took it in his hands. That painting was the last one he had done. He painted it some weeks before his parents’ death. His parents had been having marital problems which took only God’s intervention to manage. They had been on the brink of divorce and it affected everyone terribly. It all started when a guy came into the house, claiming that he was Mr. James’ son. Everyone had assumed that he was mad or on the verge of madness but they had received the shock of their lives when their dad confirmed the news. His wife hadn’t been able to comprehend the fact that she had a step-son, especially one that was almost the same age with her first son, Kelvin. Raymond and his siblings were also very shocked to find out that they had a step brother. He had destroyed the peace in the house, all bent on destroying the happiness and love which was resident in the house. Even after everyone, including his mum had come to accept the boy and forgive the mistake made by their father; the guy was still bent on destroying the family. He framed up their dad until there was no trust again.
The day everything was resolved, it was a dream come true for Raymond and his siblings because one of the people who connived with the guy came to confess and everything was resolved. He had begun that painting of his parents, telling a story of the pain they went through during that period but they never got to see the painting. He had anticipated and foreseen the smile on their faces when he handed the picture to them but it never happened. The crash burned in his memory.
For the first time since the crash, Raymond really cried. He hadn’t been able to cry. At times, it would be a few drops which he would control but he had never broken down in tears because he had feared that he would cry himself to death. It had taken the strength of Raymond and his two brothers to console their two sisters. He wondered what would have happened if they had taken the girls to the crash venue.
He turned and saw the unfinished sketch on the canvas which was still on the easel. His hands balled into fists as he willed himself to walk towards it. He swallowed hard. That was the only thing that came to his mind after the crash. After the incident, he had ran to painting, seeking refuge, hoping that it would make him forget but the opposite was what it gave him. Every time he picked up his pencil to sketch, he found himself sketching the burnt and frozen bodies he had seen. It scared him as hell and after the fifth try; he ran out of the room and never returned.
He replaced the canvas with a blank one and took out a pencil. He took a deep breath and prayed silently that his nightmare would not resurface. He had only one image on his head as he started to sketch again.
**********
**********
Luciana entered the empty church with her head covered with a shawl, to prevent people from seeing her. She had struggled with her parents until they finally allowed her to go. She walked to the pulpit feeling totally miserable. She had never been this confused, sad and angry in her life. When she got to the altar, she sat at the edge and just stared into space.
“What have I done Lord?” she began as her heart ached. “Why do I have to go through this turmoil? Why have you subjected me to this test? I know I was wrong, did not seek your consent before going for Deolu out of pressure but must I go through this pain now?” tears slipped down her cheeks and she furiously wiped them away. She swallowed as she remembered the constant calls of her parents, asking her to bring a man home. Ever since she clocked 21, the tune had changed from ‘don’t let me see you wasting your time with any boy when you need to face your studies’ to ‘you are a grown woman, when would you bring the lucky man home’. It had been tough because her mum believed that any girl that was 21 years was ripe enough for marriage. When she clocked 23 and was not even seen with anyone in the male gender, not to mention being engaged, the pressure had increased. The job away from home had been all that she needed to breathe but still, her parents kept calling and asking. She was never angry because she knew that they loved her and being the only child, their focus was constantly fixed on her. What happened when she was 20 years old and in her third year in school had distanced her from men and she had maintained that distance. Fred was the only male friend she had in school but she saw him as a friend and nothing more even though he tried to change it. Deolu came along and was even closer to her than Fred was. He was everything a lady could want in a man – a Christian who loved God, a handsome guy who could make ladies trip, a successful and independent man, and a guy who loved her so much.
It hadn’t come as a surprise when Deolu asked her out and she had accepted even though she did not love him. Of course, Deolu never knew that she did not love him but she knew that the feelings she had for Deolu were too simple and easy to be called love. She liked him and felt that was enough because she had given up on herself, saying that she was incapable of love. But here she was, madly in love with someone she had lived with for two weeks and three days. Madly in love with someone who just broke off his engagement to his fiancée immediately she entered his house. Madly in love with someone who had too many ghosts haunting his dreams. Madly in love with someone who had given up on God. Madly in love with someone whose sister is a lesbian.
“Why is this happening to me?” she screamed at the pulpit as more tears left her eyes. “I just want to be happy Lord” she sniffed. “Why am I now faced with these feelings for Raymond when I am obviously with another man?” she lamented. She knew that her heart would never allow her to leave Deolu even though she was clearly in love with Raymond. Deolu had gone through a lot when she was away, it would be suicidal if she told him that she was in love with someone else. Was that not what that useless Tunde did to Teju? Teju had told her everything shortly before she went to Abuja and Lucy had insulted Tunde, calling him all sort of names. Lucy felt she would be in the same category with Tunde if she left Deolu, even though she was not after sex.
Raymond was not perfect in any way but whenever she saw him, she saw perfection. Ever since she got to that house from the hospital and found out that Vicky was a lesbian, along with their religious status, she hadn’t stopped praying for them. Even though Ray’s physical appearance alone was enough to make any lady desire a steaming night, his looks was not the only thing she loved about him. She loved his jovial nature. She loved his ability to understand her silence within the few times they had spent together. She loved his attachment to his parents, even though it was a bit of a setback for him considering his inability to forget their death. She loved his romantic attitude. She loved his inability to cook. She loved his self confidence and independence which was very evident. The fact that he still worked under someone however surprised her. Ray was very famous, probably even more famous than Deolu but she saw and felt his humility and his down-to-earth nature. His compassion was great. She sighed and stood up. Once again, she had been carried away by thoughts centered on Raymond. She wondered if Raymond felt the same way but common sense made her feel that the feelings she had was not reciprocated because she felt that he would love his fiancée, or ex-fiancée. He had slept with his fiancée a lot, he must love her. She swallowed as jealousy threatened to choke her.
“Lord, please fix this for me. If you don’t I would end up living with Deolu, while my heart stayed with someone else” she demonstrated, like she was talking to a physical being. “I also want Fred to pay for what he did to me. Father, you know what he did. Please, fight for me” she wiped her face and went out of the church with the shawl carefully covering her face.

**********
Teju arrived at the hotel feeling satisfied. She was hundred percent sure that everything would be over in the next two days. She was always happy whenever something was going according to plan. She knocked on the door of Deolu’s room excitedly and was glowing when he opened the door.
“Well, I don’t need to ask how things went” he said as a form of greeting.
“Hi” Teju responded instead and brushed past him into the room. She looked like a kid whose mother just bought a baby doll.
“How did it go?” he asked.
“Thought you did not need to ask” she sat on the chair. “I am sure it went well.” She answered and went ahead to narrate everything to Deolu, right from the second she entered the station to the time she left. Deolu smiled through it all but was surprised by the slight annoyance and irritation he felt when she mentioned the stares and filthy comments she received from the policemen. “I was not too happy putting that man through all that” Teju confessed. “He was only trying to help his brother”
“He is a conniving beast. If not for your insistence, I would take him to court along with that bastard”
Teju understood. “I was right. He knows where he is and had been protecting him but he loves his family more. He would not want to lose his career, family and everything by protecting a criminal. He risks the penalty of death if he is caught with this act.”
“Lawyers” he murmured with admiration and Teju grinned. He hadn’t seen her this lively in days and the great happiness he felt because of her good mood surprised him. “You are here now. I want to hear everything about that guy who deliberately gave up a good thing. He must be a fool, I am not sorry to say that”
Teju sighed. She had been contented with keeping her personal life out but Deolu had made it clear that he was not going to back off. She opened her mouth and started narrating everything that happened, exactly the way she had told Lucy. Lucy had insulted the living daylight out of Tunde that she even became happy. There is always this ability and power in a woman’s tongue that could turn any saint into a villain within the twinkling of an eye. As she told Deolu, she felt Goosebumps on her skin as she shivered in remembrance. Unknown to her, tears rolled down her cheeks and it was not until Deolu wiped it away that she noticed them. Wiping them away brought fresh tears and Deolu had to hold her. He was quite used to crying women but seeing the strong and independent Teju crying tore at Deolu’s heart painfully and he also started raining insults on Tunde who was not physically present.
Everything became quiet some minutes later but Teju was still in Deolu’s arms. She started to pull away but she looked at him and became very alarmed by how close they were. Their faces were only inches apart and she could not pull back. Deolu bent his head and covered her mouth with his in a firm kiss. It took Teju some seconds to realize what was going on. She was being kissed by her best friend’s fiancé! She flew out of his arms and did not pause before swinging her palm to connect with Deolu’s cheeks.
“You bastard. You are just as evil as Tunde. How dare you kiss your fiancée’s best friend?” she asked herself the same question.
Deolu was as stunned as Teju. He did not know what devil had made him act before thinking. He did not know what he was doing until he had done it. Now, the damage had been done and he was too alarmed to utter a word. Teju looked at him like he was a demon incarnate. “I thought you loved Lucy. How dare you?” before Deolu could open his mouth, Teju’s phone rang and she picked it with shaky hands, yelling hello into the mouth piece.
She calmed down a bit when she listened to the other person, then she managed a shaky smile. “You’ve made the right decision sir. I would be there tomorrow” she hung up and stared at Deolu. She didn’t know if she was angrier at herself or Deolu. He is a man and she was the woman who should know better than to cry in the arms of a man – her best friend’s hubby.
“I don’t need you here. Please leave if you have enough dignity in you to do that. As you can see, I have everything under control and I can take care of myself” she turned towards the door.
“It is not like that Teju. I am-” Teju slammed the door hard. And Deolu blinked. “Sorry” he finished silently as he held his head which had developed a splitting headache.
**********
**********
Tinuke opened the door of Raymond’s sitting room without knocking. She wanted to see what Raymond had been up to. The first person she saw was Vicky and she frowned.
“What are you doing here?” Tinuke asked.
Vicky looked at her like she had lost her mind. Firstly, she entered without knocking and to make matters worse, she is asking her, Vicky, what she was doing in her brother’s house. Vicky clapped her head as she laughed. Her encounter with Duke fuelled her anger the more. “Oh my…” she said in her foreign voice. “You are asking me what I am doing in my brother’s house? How hilarious. Now, what the hell are you doing here?” she asked glaring. She had always hated Tinuke for her guts and audacity.
“I am here to see my fiancé” Tinuke said boldly.
Vicky laughed. “You mean, ex-fiancé”
“What are you doing here Tinuke” Raymond growled and Tinuke spun to face Ray who was at the entrance. She composed herself and moved forward to hug him.
“Baby……” she drawled as she went towards him with open hands. Ray blocked her advance with his hand,
“Answer the damn question. What the hell are you doing in my house?” he yelled now.
“I am here to give you the good news baby” she was all smiles.
“No news from you can be good” he declared.
“Was about to say the same” Vicky added.
“I am sure you would love this Ray” she paused for effect. “I am pregnant”

_EPISODE 27_

All the blood drained from Raymond’s system as those three words echoed in his brain. He could no longer hear what was being said and all the blood in his veins seemed to have flowed to his feet, making it impossible for him to move. ‘I am pregnant’ it echoed again.
Vicky clapped her hands, eyes flashing with humour and anger. “Tinuke, I have always known you to be the sneaky type but with this sort of plot, you deserve a gold medal. How dare you fake pregnancy because you want to have my brother back?”Vicky was very angry. She glanced at Raymond but he could not hear anything.
Tinuke turned furious eyes at Vicky, dangling a piece of paper before her. “That is the doctor’s report”.
“I don’t need a useless sheet of paper. You are not pregnant; but if you are, Raymond is most likely not the father”
Tinuke looked insulted. She grabbed Raymond’s hand, successfully bringing him back to his senses. “Did you hear her Ray? She is questioning my fidelity! That is why I have always hated this lesbian sister of yours”
Vicky’s hand itched to slap her but she controlled the urge. She should love the reality of being a lesbian the same way she had loved and accepted it for a long time but hearing Tinuke call her a lesbian was sounding terribly like an insult. She mentally blamed Duke for this. She hadn’t been able to think straight ever since Duke had kissed her senseless. Ray pushed Tinuke out of his way and swallowed hard. “It looks like I am on the verge of becoming an aunt” Vicky said in a jovial way, trying to bring down the tension he felt but it did not succeed.
Tinuke saw his look of doubt and confusion. “Here, have a look at the test result” she put the paper in his hand but he could not even read it. All the letters on the paper vanished before his eyes. The read meaning of being doomed stared at him terrifyingly. He had just come to accept the fact that he was truly in love with Luciana but here he was with absolutely no hope in that direction because as the devil will have it, he would be fathering a child from his demented ex-fiance. It had been during his quiet time while drawing that he realised that he actually did not love Tinuke the way he loved Lucy. Lucy had given him back his artistry, had helped him get past his fears and had secured a very tender spot in his heart in the process. When he had picked up his pencil to sketch, Lucy was the only person that posed as a model in his senses. He remembered how beautiful she looked when she had entered his room the first Sunday she spent in his house. She had gazed at his bare chest with curiosity and longing and uncertainty while she thought he was asleep. He had loved that lovely gown on her, just as he had imagined when he spotted the gown in the boutique but it was absolutely lovelier when she wore it. As he sketched, he had entertained false hopes that they would meet again someday but standing in front Tinuke, he felt all his hopes shattered. Lucy vanished from his mind and he envisioned himself carrying a crying baby which had pooped in his pants and a yelling Tinuke complaining of too much stress. He swallowed and took a deep breath.
He took out his phone and dialed a number. “Doc T…. good afternoon Doc…. I am on my way to the hospital now, are you there?…. Good. I need to carry out a pregnancy test and I need the result immediately… Ok then” he ended the call and even though the news had been too shocking to be true, he marched inside the bedroom with confidence, leaving the two ladies to stare at his wake. He returned some minutes later with his car keys and Tinuke swallowed. “Follow me” he muttered as he passed beside Tinuke and she followed like a robot. Vicky tagged along, determined to see the end of it all.
**********
**********
Deolu knocked the door for the umpteenth time. “Please open up for me Teju, please.” Just like the past futile fifteen minutes, Teju did not respond. He became weery and agitated. “If you won’t open the door, I would break it down T” Deolu warned, his voice holding the assurance that he would not hesitate in doing what he just said he would.
When no response came, he was scared that something might be wrong with Teju. He swallowed and moved several inches away from the door. “Move away from the door Teju” he said in an authoritative voice. Just as he was about to kick the door, Teju opened it and peered at him.
“What do you want?” Teju asked steely.
Deolu blinked. “I need five minutes of your time, after that you can throw me out. Please”
Teju swallowed. “I am counting already”
Some people passed by them, obviously going to their hotel rooms. “can I at least come inside?”
Teju gave it a thought and opened the door wider. Immediately he entered, she closed the door and relaxed her back against it. Deolu could not bring himself to sit down so he just paced and finally stopped some steps away from Teju. “I am sorry Teju, I am so sorry. i… I should never have done what I did but it just happened. I was not thinking straight.” He swallowed as everything he had rehearsed vanished from memory. “You know me T, I am not a betrayer, I can’t do such a thing against you or against Lucy. Please forgive me. It won’t happen again” he finished and looked straight into her eyes.
Teju swallowed. She felt so miserable. Why was she casting all the blames on Deolu when she was the one who went crying in his arms? She had effectively pulled danger to herself with her own hands, knowing how most men were with crying women. “It is not your fault. I was the crying baby, I should have had more sense than to cry shamelessly in front of you”
“No… no, you are not at fault at all; I was stupid” he said and Teju looked at him with a slow smile creeping up her face.
Deolu did not understand her smile. “It won’t repeat itself again, I promise”.
She smiled widely. “your five minutes is up” Teju said.
He swallowed and nodded. He made for the door and opened it.
“By the way, we should have Fred in our grasp tomorrow” she said as he walked out and he nodded.
“At least there is good news”. She smiled.
“We would be in Lagos faster than a sniper’s bullet”.
Deolu winced. ‘So that is how much she wants to be rid of me’ he thought vaguely, also agreeing that he really wanted to be back in a sane environment.
**********
**********
Raymond, Vicky and Tinuke sat in Doctor It’s office as they waited for the lab results. Vicky was trying to diffuse the tension which cracked the air uncomfortably.
“Just think about it Ray, it is not so bad to be a baby Dada, I am sure you would have a very beautiful baby as long as the baby is yours; that is if there is a baby”
Tinuke faced her with a face wrinkled with anger. “I would have you eat back your words when the results are out”
Vicky ignored her and continued her jest. “Imagine what it would be like to wash your baby’s buttocks after he had messed up himself. Trust me Ray, it is always helpful to think about it before it actually happens, that way, you would not be caught off guard.
Ray glared at her and she blessed him with a sisterly grin, patting his thigh with her palm, she showed that she was equally as concerned as he was.
Doctor Tunde entered the office as calmly as ever even though his face held no hint of a smile. Ray had insisted that he monitored the lab process and ensure that no mistake was made. He produced a paper containing the lab result but just as he had been unable to read anything then, he still was unable to read the lab result. He threw it back on the table. “I don’t have time for this crap Tunde, tell me what the result is”
Tunde sighed and tried to bring up a small smile. “She is positive Ray, Tinuke is pregnant…..” Doctor Tunde continued talking but Ray could not hear a single word. He felt terribly alarmed and dumbstruck. He hadn’t felt more terrible in his entire life. The thought of having a baby, his own baby, excited him but he had for long destroyed the thought of having children from someone like Tinuke. The days he stayed away from Tinuke made him realise that the attachment he had for her was because he had deflowered her. The promise he made afterwards also fuelled his closeness to her. But now, he had broken the promise promise to never leave her and now, all he wanted to do was stay far away from her. She posed a hazard to his happiness and peace of mind.
Raymond stood up slowly, not even conscious to the discussions between the people. He faced the door and walked out, ignoring Vicky and Tinu who called ceaselessly. Both of them ran after him, Tinuke playing the protective wife to be and Vicky playing the unyielding baby sister.
Vicky got to Ray faster and snatched the keys from his hands. He in turn glared at her in a way that Tinuke squirmed in fear but Vicky did not bulge a bit. She was used to Raymond’s fury and could stand him. “You can get angry all you want but I would not sit back and watch you drive us into the mouth of a waiting trailer, speeding up my ascend to heaven. If you want to die, at least wait till we get home so you can die alone.” The humor in her eyes faded when she imagined that he might actually do it. “That is not an advice”
When Ray did not leave where he was standing, she bypassed him and sat on the driver’s seat, strapping the seat belt instantly. When Ray did not leave where he was but continued to glare in her direction, she smiled lovingly and annoyingly at him. “You would want to get in the car if you don’t intend on walking home” with that, she slammed the door shut. Tinuke, who had been too scared to touch Ray considering his mood, quickly sat on the backseat of the car knowing that Vicky might speed off, leaving her behind.
Ray swore under his breath as he grudgingly went over to the other side and sat down, closing his eyes instantly.
“Oh… You finally agreed to imagine wiping your baby’s butt? It could be a really nice image”
“Vicky” Ray warned with blazing eyes. She laughed and Raymond noticed that part of the tension had seeped out of him.
Back in his office, Doctor Tunde shook his head sadly. He also had hoped to God that the result came out negative but instead, it had turned out positive. He had always felt that Tinuke was not right for Raymond but what right did he have to condemn her when it was none of his business. He had voiced his relief when Raymond had told him of their breakup but now, he had succeeded in tying himself to her for life. He felt sorry for Ray because he could vividly see that Tinu would make his life a living hell. That is why he always advised men to zip up. He sighed even when he knew that women could be terrifyingly tempting.
**********
**********
Fred lay on the bed feeling aroused the next morning. Some weeks back, he would have walked confidently to the red zone and pick any girl he wanted for the night but now, even though there was some level of security where he was, he could not afford such publicity. Wanting Lucy had led him to the redzone so many times when he could not have her. He quenched the thought of Lucy instantly and decided to masturbate.
Just as he was about to carry out the unholy act, he heard a knock on the door. He groaned as he left the bed grudgingly and made for the door. It would be either Chris or the lady who usually brought him food. If it was the lady, so help him God. He hoped she was the one as he went to the door, even though she was not really attractive. He asked who it was and his hopes shattered. He opened the door for Chris and they greeted even though Fred was not too happy to see him.
Immediately they were both seated, Chris portrayed a serious face. “I have something to show you” he took out the folded news paper from his back pocket and gave it to a curious Fred. Immediately Fred saw the major obvious, he shivered and dropped the paper. The picture of Lucy which he had seen was too real. It was as if she were staring at him with accusing eyes.
“She… She has been… Found” she stammered.
“Yes. I thought of erm… Bringing this to you so you could see with your eyes.”
Fred swallowed, his arowsal long forgotten. They heard a knocked and Fred looked questioningly at Chris. “Are you expecting someone?”
“Yes, I came with one of my boys who rushed off to eat. He must be the one”
Fred smiled as he remembered his earlier thought when he heard the first knock. “Come in” he murmured and faced Chris to continue their discussion.
He saw Chris’ eyes on the door and he turned and shrieked the at the sight before him. He had paled terribly and was glued to the chair. Teju smiled and entered the room with her usual flair and style.
“We meet again Fred” she said with a smile that had the evident glint of anger. Fred shivered uncontrollably.

_EPISODE 28_
Two weeks ago, the tension had been thick in the air, filling everyone with dread and discomfort but thanks to the help of everyone, especially Deolu and Teju, there was a breathing space. They had been able to secure the arrest of Fred who was currently under detention, awaiting trial. Lucy felt the freedom to move freely again and was just too happy about it. She immediately went back to work amidst so many protests and complains from her parents but Lucy did not want to risk losing her employment in one of the fast growing advertising firms in Nigeria. She however could not stay there because her boss gave her leave for one month, wanting her to get everything settled before she finally resumed. Even though she had wanted her job to take her mind off the problems she faced, she was grateful for the break, even though she knew that she would pay for it when she finally resumed because they would wear her out with duties.
Lucy remembered the day that her parents had gone to Raymond’s house. They had been so excited when they arrived, talking endlessly about their discussions with Raymond. They had exclaimed, asking why she did not tell them that he was the well-known artist. They had returned with a painting and Lucy noticed that she hadn’t seen that particular painting when she entered that room. Even though the paintings had been much and she could hardly see half of them, she had the distinctive feeling that the painting was new. That was probably the reason why he gave the painting to her parents; to tell her that he had moved on. She felt happy for him if that was the case, although, she had wished that Raymond would send her parents to her, to either tell her something or request something but he hadn’t. it had alarmed her when she noticed just how much she missed and desired to see him.
Teju entered the room and jumped on Lucy’s bed. Bewaji and Ken had gone for a wedding function and Lucy had had the house to herself. “Hey beautiful” Teju called.
Lucy glanced at the wall clock and stared at Teju. “Are you not supposed to be at work?”
“You are not the only one who can be given leave, durr” Teju grinned. She grabbed Lucy’s hand and dragged her. “Get your sorry ass out of bed, I am hungry”
“Holy father” Lucy exclaimed, wanting to beat up Teju for disturbing her brain. “You know that Dana is in the kitchen right?” she murmured as Teju continued to drag her into the kitchen.
“Yeah, she is. But since when did she start serving my food? I am in my house babe”
“The more reason why you should serve yourself” Lucy responded, although admitted secretly that she was hungry too.
“You see? You are also hungry”
Lucy glared at her. “You are a witch”
She laughed. “And you are a witch’s best friend. And as the saying goes, show me your friend and I would tell you who you are or who you would be” she grinned.
Lucy shook her head. “you need deliverance”
“I would book appointment for two with the pastor”
Dana laughed out at the two friends who could not stop teasing each other. She loved listening and watching them and suddenly wished she also had a best friend.
“Tell me we are not the cause of your laughter” Lucy murmured and Dana portrayed an innocent face. The two laughed and left the kitchen for the dinning with their plates of rice in hand. They prayed and delved into the food with vigor, only relaxing when the food was halfway through and the worst part of hunger had been eliminated. “T.J” Lucy called.
“Yes ma’am” Teju replied cynically.
“I want you to follow me somewhere”
“OK maam”
“Be serious my friend” Lucy snapped.
“I have never been this serious honey” she grinned and Lucy sighed.
“I need you to follow me to Raymond James’ house. I need to thank him personally for what he did for me. I don’t want to seem ungrateful”
Teju stared at Lucy. “You have been calling him Raymond ever since you arrived but calling him Raymond James makes him sound different. Why does that name sound popular?” she looked thoughtful and Lucy smiled internally. She had successfully hid that fact from Teju knowing fully well that she would squeal when she found out. “Surely it is not James Ray” she waved her hand like she was wiping away the possibility but when Lucy smiled cynically, Teju’s eyes rounded like two lolly pops. “He is not the one right?”
Lucy grinned. “Guess I was lucky to see your James Ray before you”
“Oh my God!” Teju exclaimed and Lucy laughed. “When were you planning on telling me, naughty” she scolded.
“Now, I guess… so are you coming with me?”
“Are you kidding? I would get there before you”. They laughed. As they packed their plates to the kitchen, someone knocked and Dana went to open the door. They entered the sitting room and saw Deolu approaching them with a cool smile
“Hello ladies” he greeted and they responded albeit similarly. He kissed Luciana’s forehead and stepped back. Lucy noticed that he hadn’t been the same since he returned from Abuja. He had made a habit of kissing her forehead instead of any other place and Lucy was happy about this turn up. She felt guilty for not being able to return his feelings and having him kiss her all the time would make her feel more guilty and awkward. Despite that fact though, she was curious. Apart from Deolu’s strange behaviour’s of late, she had also noticed Teju’s discomfort whenever Deolu was around. She wondered what had happened in Abuja. It seemed Teju was back to her usual aloaf nature whenever Deolu was around even though they seemed like the best of friends when Lucy came back from exile. She had shrugged it off, feeling that Teju’s reactions towards Deolu had something to do with Tunde and her general distance from men lately but Lucy decided that there was something more to it. Teju hardly talked or looked at Deolu lately and Deolu did the opposite. He looked at her more and tried to talk to her more even though Teju was always reluctant to answer him. The next line of action was that Teju always looked for a reason to leave whenever Deolu was around. Lucy expected to feel jealous and put-off by this new turn-up but she was not.
As they discussed, Lucy noticed this same thing repeating itself. She noticed the look of sadness in Deolu’s face whenever he stared at Teju and Teju paid him no heed and only looked at him when their faces collided coincidentally. Lucy was about to break the ice and speak her mind when Deolu’s phone rang.
“Hello dear” he said immediately he picked the call. “No, don’t come to my house… yes, I am not home… where are you now?… ok… I am not far from you, I am in my fiancee’s house… Yes, it is about time you met her… I would send the address now” he hung up and smiled.
“My step-sister is coming. She has been clamouring to see you”. Lucy smiled.
“I should be on my way now” Teju said, standing.
“Why not meet my sister first?” Deolu asked.
“No. I have some work to do”
“Thought you were on leave” Lucy said
“It is not official. See you guys”
Before anyone could reply, she was out already and Lucy glimpsed a look of pain on Deolu’s face but it went quickly. She swallowed as her mind brought up the most logical explanation for the tension.
**********
**********
Raymond sat in his office ruminating over the events in his life. His life hadn’t felt so shattered. He almost could not believe that those things were actually happening to him. He had been sleeping with Tinuke ever since they were together as she never returned pregnant because he always took precautions and watched her take drugs but just when he decided to vent his anger through sex, it ended up being a terrible mistake. He was going to be a dad!
He recalled the visit of Luciana’s parents and sighed audibly. He had needed no introduction to know that they were her parents. Lucy looked exactly like her mum. Her mum had been so stunningly beautiful that he wondered how beautiful she would still look when she clocked ninety. She was dazzling and breathtaking, no wonder Lucy’s father was glowing. His life must feel blessed, being surrounded by two dazzling beauties. He noticed that Lucy had her father’s shape of pointed nose. He swallowed as Luciana’s image popped in his mind. He could remember everything about her, including the colour shade of her hair although he hadn’t been opportune to feel the texture much even though he would love nothing more.
Raymond drove all thought of Luciana away from his brain. He knew now without a doubt that there could be nothing between them. Even though Luciana’s parents had given him the goodnews of the arrest of the miserable bastard that stabbed Lucy, Raymond still saw the overwhelming barreer between them. Lucy was with a man already and he felt that she should also be in love with the guy. If that was not enough reason, being saddled with a baby was more than enough reason. He dared not visit Lucy even though her parents had dropped their address in case he wanted to visit.
After he left the hospital, he had wanted to drink himself to death but Vicky would not hear of it. He drove out of the house to get a drink outside after he had successfully sent Tinuke away with a promise to call her. He had spotted a church – the same church Lucy dragged him to – and instead of going for the drink, he went to the church to vent his anger on God. A pastor had sighted him and prayed with him, relieving him of a lot of stress by talking to him. Despite all that, Raymond’s craving for Lucy did not decrease. He was madly in love with her but could not do anything about it. There are times when you have to put responsibility before love.

Vicky opened the door and jumped back, not wanting to be too close to Duke. “Ray is not here. Go to his office” she hurriedly said.
“If I wanted to see him, I would not be here” he said confidently, closing the door behind him. Vicky shivered and he smiled. “If I didn’t know better, I would say my presence had some effects on you”. She remained mute, moving backwards slowly as he advanced towards her. “Don’t look frightened, I am not a serial killer” he murmured as he took in her appearance. She was putting on a multicoloured tube top with a pencil jeans trouser. A jeans jacket was lying on the couch. “You look beautiful” he breathed as she collided with the wall and he pinned her to it with his hands on either side.
“I always do” she swallowed, angry that her heart raced wild. She remembered Lucy’s words. ‘You would not have to try’. Vicky shook off the words from her head. She cant be falling for Duke. No!
Duke brushed away some stray braids from her face as his eyes probed hers. He bent his head and gave her a quick kiss and vanished instantly, leaving her with a sense of loss. She followed him with her eyes as he headed towards the kitchen. He turned and met her eyes. He smiled softly. “Come on, you need something to eat. Your stomach is growling with hunger”
Vicky hadn’t noticed how hungry she was until he mentioned it and she wondered how he noticed. She entered the kitchen as Duke broke and whezzed some eggs. “Do you actually know what you are doing” she had a faint smile on her face.
He turned with a smile. “Cut the crap, I am not Raymond who can’t boil an egg, I could open up a restaurant if I want to”
“Don’t be so sure. Lucy taught him well and now, I let him do the cooking at times and he surprises me with delicious delicacies”
He laughed. “I would like to taste that” He took a deep breath and turned back to face what he was doing. He got a pan and placed it on the burner to heat up and Vicky walked to him, standing beside him. She retrieved two cups from the cup stand and started putting beverages into them. Duke breathed uncomfortably. “Could you please put on that jacket I saw on the couch? Your bare shoulders in too much distraction”.
She smiled. “I prefer the cool breeze I am getting without the jacket”
He groaned internally and knew that keeping his hands away from her would be difficult.
They sat to eat some minutes later and resisted the urge to sit beside her and sat opposite. Vicky was disturbed by her attraction towards Duke. The eggs tantalized her taste buds and she became instantly aware of her empty stomach. She murmured praises as she ate and Duke watched her, not knowing that one could derive pleasure from watching someone eat. He managed to shove food down his throat when the only thing he wanted to do was watch Vicky eat. When she finished her eggs, he passed his own to her and she accepted it without hesitating. She must be really hungry, he mussed.
“You should try to avoid being too hungry before you eat” he quipped.
“You should try to make less delicious eggs, so that people don’t get too hungry” she returned and he grinned.
“it is not my fault that I am so talented”
“Don’t blow your own” she smiled. He looked into her eyes until she was forced to look away.
“I should be leaving now” he said, rising. She packed the plates into the kitchen even though he wanted to do it. She started washing the plates and he grabbed the towel to dry them.
“Thought you were leaving” she murmured as he took the plates from her and dried them.
“Yes” he said.
“And?”
“I wanted to steal something from you before I leave” he dried the last plate.
She faced him. “What is that”
He pulled her into his arms and kissed her deeply, making her head spin. He held her so close to him, with his hands on her shoulders. He broke off breathlessly and kissed her forehead. “Take care of you” he said and walked out.

**********
Deolu and Luciana sat on the couch watching a movie. The movie was so emotional and touching. When we heard the knock, Deolu stood up and headed towards the entrance. “That must be Tinu” he said.
Immediately he opened the door, Lucy heard a familiar voice and also went to the entrance.
“Big brother” Tinu hugged Deolu. “Still as handsome as ever” she said
“And you are even more beautiful. You even look fatter”
Tinuke smiled, knowing the cause of her weight but not even daring to mention it.
Immediately Deolu and Tinuke heard someone approach, they turned and Tinuke froze, along with Lucy.
Deolu smiled, not noticing the tension. “Tinu, meet my sweetheart Luciana, Lucy, meet my sister, Tinuke”
“Brenda” Tinuke exclaimed.
“No. not Brenda, I said Luciana”
“No. this is the girl that I said stole my Raymond from me. This is Brenda” Tinuke exclaimed.

_*SEMI FINAL*_
_EPISODE 29_

Tinuke was busy glaring at Luciana as anger bubbled up in her. Deolu look from an obviously angry Tinuke to a stunned and frozen Luciana and laughed softly. “This must be a mixup. This is not Brenda, this is Luciana. Luciana Jones to be precise, the woman I told you about”.
“Oooohhh… I hate it when you doubt me. Ask her if she does not know me, or has she become deaf and dumb?” Tinuke yelled.
Luciana swallowed and faced Deolu. “Is she your sister?”
“Who else would I be? Oh… you thought you could take what belongs to be and still have my brother? You have failed. Bro Deolu, you have not seen your bride ooo” she ranted on top of her voice.
A confused Deolu faced Lucy. “The Raymond you have been talking about is not James Ray, right?”
Lucy breathed. “He is the one. He was the one that found me and took care of me” her voice was low.
Deolu swallowed. He remembered when Tinuke had introduced Raymond to him as her fiancé. He had instantly known why Tinuke would fall for him. He was drop-dead gorgeous and could sweep any girl off her feet without even trying. “I am sure you are mistaken Tinu. Raymond saved Lucy after she had been stabbed. I am sure you misjudged whatever you saw”.
Tinuke laughed. “Misjudged” she repeated, her face bringing up a look of scorn. “Immediately she was discharged from the hospital, Ray brought her to the house. Immediately she entered, he drove me out. That same day!” she exclaimed. “They were there alone. A man and a woman, alone in that big house Deolu” she laughed slightly. “And you tell me that I misjudged them. Wonderful”
“Point of correction miss, we were not alone in that house. Yes, immediately you left, I was alone in the house with him that day but the following day, his sister arrived. Besides, I did not make him drive you out of the house, on the contrary, your bad character drove you out.”
Tinuke’s palm swung with speed and connected with Luciana’s cheek.
“What the hell!” Deolu exclaimed and grabbed Tinuke’s hand with force. “Apologise to her this minute. Now” he yelled as Lucy stood with fire burning in her eyes.
“Apologize my foot” Tinuke dropped. “Let me tell you witch, you can’t take Raymond from me. We are back together and we would remain together forever” she contemplated saying something and decided against it. “So, if you know what is best for you, you would stay away from my man.”
Deolu gripped her arm with force but she did not agree to apologize.
Lucy advanced towards her slowly, keeping her eyes glued to her. She stood breast to breast with her as they glared at each other. Deolu could not even do anything anymore because none of them seemed to notice him.
“Let me give you some advice: sit yourself down and tell yourself the truth. You don’t love Raymond. You are only after his money and fame” Tinuke laughed but Lucy ignored it. “You also need to tame your tongue, woman. I heard all your arguments with Ray before you left and I wondered how he could cope with you. He is a very wonderful guy and he deserves a woman who loves him wholeheartedly.”
Tinuke sneered. “And you are the woman right?”
Lucy kept a straight face and walked away from her. “Deolu, it was nice meeting your sister” she walked out of the house.
Deolu turned his rage on Tinuke.
**********
**********
Deolu met Lucy at the garden some minutes later, staring into space. He touched her shoulder and she jerked slightly. “Lucy” he called softly. “I am so sorry”
Lucy smiled faintly as he glanced at her cheeks to see if there was any bruise on it. “I wonder why you are apologizing. You did nothing wrong. I am at fault here”.
“No. I have always known Tinu to be saucy and abusive, I should not have invited her over”
“It is not your fault she is like that, you invited her because you felt it was right” she responded then turned to face him. “Do you think I cheated on you?”
“What? How would you think that? I can’t believe my sister over you; I trust you” he stated fiercely.
“I trust you too, and with that trust, I want to ask you something. Before we became erm… we were friends before we moved on to this next stage” she paused, knowing how awkward she just sounded. Deolu noticed it but kept quiet. “I want you to assume us friends again, just friends, and answer this question honestly. What is going on between you and T.J?”
Deolu became as white as snow and started stammering. “Lu…Lucy… Lucy what…”
“I thought I told you to be honest with me. I know T.J and I know you very well. I know my best friend would never ever do something against me knowingly. The same goes for you. Confide in me like you once did as a friend, please. I am begging” her eyes pleaded.
Deolu swallowed hard. “Erm…” he stared at the ground. “While we were in Abuja, we… I…” he inhaled. “I was asking about her fiancé and she got emotional and I…”
“You kissed her” Lucy completed.
“I am sorry. I did not know what came over me, it was just due to the emotional atmosphere. Teju is not to blame at all, I am totally at fault. It would never repeat itself. Please” he rushed, holding Lucy’s hand.
“You love her” Lucy said, surprised that she did not feel bad about the realisation. He shook his head vigorously. “I have seen the way you look at her Deolu, there is this tender look in your eyes whenever you gaze at her, especially since you both returned from Abuja. You never looked at me that way Deolu, accept it”
“Don’t talk like that Lucy, it was just one kiss. One kiss when we were not thinking”.
“What if I told you that I am not in love with you? What if we were just friends? Would your response still be the same?”
Startled, Deolu frowned deeply. “What the hell are you talking about?”
Lucy moved towards him. “Deolu, I love Teju so much. She is the sister I never had and I want her to be very very happy. Nothing would make me happier than seeing her smile again. Tunde has wrecked her heart and she is no longer glowing like she once was. I want you to be sure of your feelings. No matter what you decide, you would always be my close friend. If you love Teju, go for her; it would make me very happy. Denying your feelings would not be right”. Lucy took a deep breath and walked away, leaving Deolu stunned and confused.
**********
**********
Two days later, Lucy entered Teju’s apartment with a cool smile on her face. “Hey sweetie, I can smell chicken here, where is it?”
“Oh… it is knorr chicken” Teju responded and they both laughed. Lucy glanced at the table and saw loads of books there.
“Hmmmm… barrister” she hailed.
“That’s me” Teju laughed. All she had been doing lately was working.
“How is Fred’s case coming?” Lucy sat down.
“Well, we have the first hearing in three weeks but we need to get our proof. Remember our little drama?”
“Yeah, definitely. He won’t have a prayer when he sees me” Lucy said with hate in her voice.
Teju swallowed. “Lucia” she called. “I know you. There is more to this issue and you are hiding it from me. Apart from stabbing you, what else did Fred do to you to make you hate him so much?”
“He raped me” Teju gasped. “He raped me Teju” Tears rolled down Lucy’s cheeks.
“Oh my God!”
“When I was in my third year in UI, Fred was the closest male friend I had. He asked me out several times but I refused. I had just returned to school for my second semester in 300 level when the unexpected happened. My room mate was yet to arrive and I was the only one in the room. A masked man entered and pushed me hard on the bed. Then, I used to sleep with a short loose gown because we rarely had light and I hated the heat. He was stronger than me and I could not do much to help myself. Hitting him was like hitting a rock because it had almost no effect on him” Lucy cried uncontrollably as Teju held her with her eyes burning with anger. “That day, he took my virginity from me and shattered my life. I never knew it was the same person whom I saw as my friend. The night he stabbed me, he said all these, thinking I was dead. He probably said everything out of fright; he also blamed everyone for making him stab me that day. Said he was going to get even with Deolu and everyone that surrounded me” she leaned against Teju. “Do you know just how much I hate him?” she yelled.
Teju swore loudly. “That bastard would pay dearly, I promise you!!!”
**********
**********
Raymond drove furiously. He had finished muttering all the curses he knew of and was busy repeating them. He could not believe that his so called step-brother would have the effrontery to call him after all he had done. Because of him, his parents were no more, because of him, their united family had drifted apart. Now, he got himself into a mess and he suddenly thought that he had a family? Ray shook his head. Never in his life would he raise a finger to help a miserable bastard. He had prayed for a time when he would be able set his eyes on his mistake of a brother to give him a piece of his mind.
He parked and entered the police station.
“Raymond”
He turned like an automatic car at the sound of that voice. “Lucy” he gasped. Sighting her, his heartbeat accelerated. “Oh my God! Lucy”
Lucy rushed into his arms as he hugged her tightly. He inhaled deeply as he put his nose in her hair, allowing the scent of her to awaken his senses. His heart pounded wildly as he held her, unable to let her go. Lucy could not believe what was happening. She felt the strange desire to kiss him there in public.
“I have missed you a lot sugar” he whispered, finally pulling back.
Lucy cleared her throat. “I missed you too”
“Never did a day pass without me thinking about you” he said softly, gazing into her eyes.
Lucy was so overwhelmed, she did not know what to do or say. “Me too… I mean… erm”
Ray brushed his hand, slowly and lightly across her cheek, making her catch her breath. “You are crying?” he looked deeply worried.
“Crying?” she also looked puzzled. She rubbed her face vigorously. “Of course not. Perhaps something entered my-”
He bent his head and kissed her silent but as his lips touched hers, he could not break away. He pulled her into his hands and kissed her deeply, forgetting that they were in police station. They both forgot everything around them and held on to each other, without letting go. It took a police officer’s tap on raymond’s shoulders to separate them.
“Oga abeg, this place na station, no be hotel wey you go dey romance woman” the policeman stated flatly as the other policemen laughed.
Lucy righted herself, feeling stupid and terribly breathless. What am I doing? She wondered.
“Hey babe, did I …” Teju’s face reddened as her eyes widened. “James Ray” she muttered as she took in the person before her.
“Raymond, meet Teju my best friend, T.J, meet Raymond” Lucy introduced still feeling terribly uncomfortable.
It took Teju’s barrister instincts to stop her from screaming and fussing like a kid.
“It is a pleasure, I heard a lot about you” Ray said, delighted to meet the Teju that Lucy always talked about. She was as beautiful as Lucy said.
“I am honoured. I have always prayed for a day like this; I am a huge fan. But more importantly, thank you for what you did for my little baby here, I am eternally grateful”
“I did what anyone would have done. Besides, how could I resist saving such a beautiful lady? I have been trained to be a gentleman” he grinned.
“You surely are” Teju said, heard her name and smiled. “I would be back” she pinched Lucy and ran off.
“Ouch” Lucy said softly and Ray smiled. Lucy felt uncomfortable, being left alone with him, it was as if the policemen at the counter had vanished even though they were still there. She shifted uncomfortably. “What brought you here?”
“God” he gazed into her eyes. She looked away, too shy to respond to the taunt and he smiled, knowing that it was that shy attitude that amused him most about her. “Actually, I am here, though unwillingly, to see my mistake of a brother. Step-brother actually. Fred”
“Who?” Lucy blanched.
“Fred. He called for me and I came to give him a piece of my mind” his anger returned slightly.
“Fred? Your brother”
“Stepbrother actually. I wish he wasn’t. I know I never told you about him, he is like a prodigal son.”
Lucy fumbled with her phone and Ray became worried. “Is it this person?”
He stared at the picture on his phone and frowned deeply. “Yes. How do..”
“Oh my God” Lucy gasped as she stared at Raymond with tears coming rapidly.
“What is it sugar?” she backed away when he tried to touch her. He was instantly alarmed.
“No! That is the guy that stabbed me”
Raymond froze as he stared at her.
“He stabbed me” she exclaimed.
“Ray”. They both turned and faced Tinuke who approached with anger in her stride.
The day couldn’t have been more worse, Raymond thought. “What the hell are you doing here Tinu? Are you trailing me now?”
“No. I came to visit a friend nearby and I saw your car and knew you were here.” She faced Lucy. “Have I not warned you to stay away from my man? You are trying to tie him up with crocodile tears right?” Lucy was too shocked and stunned to pay Tinuke any attention. “Accept defeat my dear. Guess what? I am pregnant. I am carrying Raymond’s baby”.
Lucy froze, wondering if she had heard correctly. She shifted her gaze to Raymond but he did not look shocked, he had obviously been informed. She held her head and ran out in tears, not hearing teju who was busy calling her.
Teju held back Raymond when he tried to pursue Lucy. Tinuke saw her and gasped. “Raymond, I do not intend to meddle in your private affair but I suggest you find out if that child she is carrying is truly yours. She stole my fiancé from me six weeks ago by offering him her body, don’t get saddled with a bastard” she fixed Tinuke a cold glare and ran off to catch up with Lucy.
**********
**********
Roaring fire would have been the perfect description for Raymond’s mood when he got home. He hadn’t been able to go through with seeing Fred, and not that he cared but Tinuke’s matter seemed more important.
“What is wrong Ray?” Vicky asked immediately he marched inside. Ray was in no mood to give answers because he himself wanted answers. Immediately Tinuke entered, Vicky got her answers.
“Please Ray, believe me, they are toying with your head. I have never set my eyes on that lady. Neither do I know any Tunde”
Ray tried desperately to calm his nerves. “I am not disputing that fact, just give me the results.”
“Did I not say she was carrying a bastard?” Vicky laughed.
“Shut it Vic” Raymond yelled, losing his temper, which he rarely did. Tinuke always pushed him to the wall.
“Hey, don’t vent your anger on me. It is not my fault that this tramp is a harlot”
“I would have you swallowing your words” Tinuke said to Vicky, successfully retrieving the paper from her handbag.
Raymond knew that if she was truly pregnant for him, she should be two months and one week gone by now but since the test was carried out two weeks ago, he blanched then he saw one month, three weeks. Tinuke touched him. “I told you that she lied”
Ray shook his head, refusing to give up. “Let’s go to the hospital”
“No! I am not leaving this place.”
“Of course you are” Vicky said, moving towards her. “Move before I move you”
Raymond was already in the car and Vicky successfully moved Tinuke to the car.
They all alighted from the car in silence and marched into the hospital.
“Doc T. Please I need the lab results of the pregnancy test we did two weeks ago” he did not bother greeting.
Doctor Tunde opened his drawer. “I knew you would ask for it later.”
“How far gone is she?”
The doctor looked at the paper. “Well, here, she is one month and about one week gone. Since it was conducted two weeks ago, she should be one month, three weeks pregnant”.
Vicky hollered. “I said it!”
“There must be a mistake” Tinuke was shaking.
“There is no mistake woman, I monitored it myself. Should the timing be longer or shorter?” The doctor asked curiously.
“It doesn’t matter doc T. I am forever in your debt. He stood and walked out with a billion dollar smile on his face.”

_EPISODE 30_

Teju brushed her hair with a brush before using a comb. She considered the long hair a waste of time because it always gave her trouble when she needed to comb it. For the umpteenth time, she considered cutting it. She took her hair bond and held her hair firmly behind her head. She was worried about Luciana. Lucy had not said much to her ever since she fled from the police station about a week ago. She had become withdrawn and quiet. Teju wished she had heard what transpired between Lucy, Raymond and that Oyin girl who turned out to be Tinuke, Raymond’s fiancée. The only part she had heard was the part where Tinuke declared that she was pregnant. She wondered if her pregnancy was what made Lucy flee. Even though Teju was sure that the child was not for Raymond, she wondered why that information would affect Lucy so much. Except…
Teju shook her head. Lucy was not one to date several men at a goal, in fact, she was not into men. That brought her to Lucy’s attitude with Deolu. Deolu was a man that every woman would dream to have – someone who is loving, handsome, faithful, hardworking, established and so on; but she noticed that Lucy still behaved with him the same way she used to when they were friends. Teju did not see the spark of a woman in love in her eyes but she had noticed something when she was with Raymond in the station. It was not the look of a fan to celebrity she saw in Lucy’s eyes, she saw that glow, that discomfort that the presence of a man could bring out of a lady; especially a lady in love. “No” she murmured to herself. She needed to see Lucy and make her talk by all means.
She heard a knock and went there to open. Her heartbeat skipped severally when she saw the person at the door. “What are you doing here Deolu?”
“I actually love it when you call me Dee” his deep voice vibrated around her and she shifted nervously.
She smiled softly. “That does not answer my question”
“And I suppose that is the newest mode of greeting. Are you going to invite me in?” he did not wait for her answer as he stepped into the well furnished apartment. Teju bit back a groan as she closed the door slightly, not wanting to take anything for granted. She would not allow what happened in Abuja to repeat itself. “I have missed you Tee, I have not seen you for eight days now, which is ever since you left Lucy’s place, giving the lame excuse of an ‘unofficial’ engagement”.
Teju swallowed and breathed slowly, as slowly as she could manage. “Listen Dee” she wondered if she just called him that spontaneously or if she did because he said he liked it. “I know I should have forgotten that little accident in Abuja but I have not because I can’t help the feeling of guilt whenever I am with Lucy. I can’t have you around me Deolu” she took a calming breath.
“And do you think you are the only one with feelings? Listen; ever since I kissed you, I have not been able to think straight. I have had-”
“Stop it” she yelled. “Don’t make me hate you”
“You can hate me all you want but please listen to me” he paced restlessly and Teju could see how he struggled to keep his emotions at check. An instant panic grew within her as her heart raced wildly. Deolu went to stand in front of her and took a calming breathe. “I don’t know when you started growing on me Teju” he began and anger came up within her as she looked at the man who was trying to come between two friends.
“Deolu”
“Please let me talk Tee” he groaned and walked to the window, staring out. His fists folded and unfolded. “I don’t know if it was when Lucy introduced me to you, you were putting on a flimsy short gown which barely covered your thigh and you had me wondering how you could wear that cloth comfortably” he breathed. Teju was stunned that he could remember what she wore that day. She also remembered that he had been looking too handsome in a grey suit and a white shirt. “Or maybe it was when we had to deal with Lucy’s disappearance together” he turned to face her and she was thrown off-balance by the look of struggle and discomfort she saw. She concentrated on breathing properly. “I found myself thinking about you at very inappropriate times. You occupied my thoughts and I discarded it, thinking that my feelings towards you were platonic. Even though I was terribly worried about Luciana’s safety, I discovered that being with you made me feel great and happy and I always found one excuse or the other to see you”.
“Deolu-”
He grabbed her hands. “I love you Teju. Ever since we left Abuja, I could think of no one else but you. Hearing what you Ex did to you made me want to live the rest of my life putting smiles on your face. I –”
“Jesus, Deolu” she yelled, snatching her hands from his. “Are you crazy? I found out that men were cruel and heartless but I never counted you with them because I thought you were different. Jesus! You are Lucy’s boyfriend!” she exclaimed. “Do you know who Lucy is to me?” she roamed her sitting room in anger. “She is my best friend. Did you hear that? My best friend!” she screamed, throwing her hands up in the air. “You know what? Just leave. I know what to do; I would go and clear my conscience with Lucy. Leave Deolu, please” she yelled.
“Teju-”
“Leave” Teju screamed and propelled him to the door, slamming the door hard. Tears clung to her eyes and she blinked them away. She had vouched never to cry for a man; she just was not sure why men always tried to toy with her feelings. As must as she tried to prevent the tears, they came rolling down her cheeks and she wiped them away furiously. She had successfully locked away her feelings for Deolu, not willing to allow a man come between she and Luciana. Why must men behave so unfairly with her? She grabbed her purse and left the apartment with a mind to put a stop to this drama.
**********
**********
Lucy lay on the bed looking lost. No one had been able to get her out of her moody state. Life was so unfair to her. How could she love the brother of someone who had brought her so much sorrow? How could she be in love with a rapist’s brother? Her head ached terribly as she made her way to the window. Then the second obstacle: he was expecting a baby!
Lucy had never felt so miserable in her life. She never fell in love but now that she was, she was in love with the wrong person; in love with the brother of her worst enemy. Lucy wondered what sort of test God was putting her through. She just wanted to be happy, to feel loved for once in her life.
Her door flung open and she spun, wiping away the tears in her face. Lucy had never seen Teju so shaky and uncertain. She looked like she had been crying. “Teju, are you alright” Lucy asked, alarmed with concern.
Teju prevented Luciana from moving close to her. “Please don’t come closer Lucy, don’t make me feel guiltier than I currently do. Please”
“What is the matter T.J?”
“I have betrayed our friendship Lucy; I need to tell you something before the guilt kills me. Please promise me that you would forgive me”
Luciana breathed. If she were to choose a friend over and over again, she would always choose Teju. She opened her arms and hugged Teju, knowing that they were both going through trying times. “I know what you are about to say”
“You do?” Teju was bewildered as she left Luciana’s arms.
“Does it have to do with Deolu?” Lucy asked with a faint smile
Teju blanched. “I knew it. When you refused to speak with me, I knew that something was wrong. I did not mean to do it. It was a… a mistake. Please forgive me babe, I did not mean to do it” she rushed with pleading eyes. “He told you?”
Lucy nodded. “Do you love him?”
Startled. “What sort of question is that? He is your man Lucy; I can’t take him from you. What happened was a mistake which would never repeat itself again. Please”
“He is not my man” Lucy dropped, sitting down with a sour look. “I am not in love with him”
“What are you saying?”
“I accepted him not because I loved him the way I ought to but because I thought that I should be able to love him after some time”
Teju regained her composure to a certain extent as her earlier suspicion materialized. “Does this have to do with Raymond?” Lucy froze and Teju got her answer.
Lucy changed the subject. “Deolu told me how he felt about you T.J” Teju shifted uncomfortably and stood up furiously. “He loves you a lot. I have never seen him so confused. I advised him to tell you how he felt”
“He already did”
Lucy jumped out of the bed. “He did? What was your response?”
“What do you expect? That I would jump into the arms of my best friend’s boyfriend? I can never do that?” Lucy swallowed and pulled Teju back to the bed.
“Teju. You know how much you mean to me. You are my friend and sister and I can never deceive you. When Deolu told me of his feelings for you three days ago, I saw the sincerity in his eyes. Even when he had asked me out, I did not see what I saw in his eyes. You deserve to be very happy T.J and I know that Deolu would make you the happiest woman in the world. I have noticed the way you look at him Teju. Answer me honestly; do you love him?”
Teju swallowed and looked down. She had never felt more like a complete idiot in her life. Here she was receiving love lectures from the same Lucy whom she always confronted with the idea of getting a man in her life. “I don’t know” she said softly.
Lucy smiled. “Think about it. Don’t be unfair to Deolu. The heart goes where it wills; it is not his fault that he is in love with you. Believe me when I say he is the man of every woman’s dreams, it is just a pity that I could not fall in love with him, and instead, I loved the wrong person”. Her heart ached even though she knew that loving Raymond was the best feeling she ever had.
“I saw the look in your eyes when you stared at Raymond”
Lucy breathed deeply. “He is Fred’s step-brother”
“He is not” Teju gasped wide-eyed.
“I am in love with the brother of the guy that raped me and almost killed me. Am I not lucky?” tears streamed her face.
“Oh Lucy” Teju held her tight, barely taking in what she just heard. She could only imagine what Lucy was feeling. “It is alright honey” she whispered.
“No. it is not alright. How am I supposed to deal with that? Upon that, Deolu’s step-sister is pregnant for him”
“Wait a freaking minute, Deolu’s what?”
“Yes. Tinuke, Raymond’s fiancée is Deolu’s step-sister.”
Teju jumped to her feet. “That is the woman that snatched Tunde away from me”
Lucy’s eyes widened. “Holy Father”
**********
**********
Lucy and Teju happily entered Teju’s apartment with bags in their hands. After their heated discussion a week ago, they had both decided that they needed a break. They left their apartments and went sight-seeing. They both dropped their phones at home, not wanting their problems to interrupt their break. They had gone to the zoo together, went to the museum, to amusement parks and finally went to the beach before deciding to go back home. They had lodged in a hotel for the week and the two friends had made their friendship stronger. They were no longer best friends but they were sisters. Sisters whose ties were stronger than the legendary blood tie. They dumped the bags on the floor and collapsed on different chairs.
“Don’t just lie there, go and prepare food. You want me to die of hunger?” Luciana muttered.
“We would both die of hunger if you don’t stand up and enter that kitchen” Teju responded, removing her shoes.
None of them could stand up due to fatigue and were both startled when they heard a knock. “Can those neighbors not allow me to breathe a bit before bombarding me with questions about where I have been all week?” Teju murmured slightly as she made for the door. When she opened the door, she saw an unfamiliar face.
“Please, how may I help you?”
“Sorry to disturb…”
Lucy jumped up at the sound of that familiar voice. “Vicky” she called and moved towards her with smiles of surprise and happiness.
“Well, I was not wrong” Vicky said with smiles and hugged Lucy.
“How did you know this place?”
“Well, I was driving somewhere when I saw you. I knew I couldn’t be mistaken so I followed you guys until I found you. Why did you run off?”
“Do I get an introduction?” Teju asked cynically. Lucy smiled and introduced them. They all sat in the sitting room some minutes later until Teju excused herself in order to take a cold shower.
“Raymond is almost going crazy. He has been to your house three times but he could not find you. Your parents told him to be patient that you would be back soon but he had been killing himself with worry. He called your line but it was always off”
Lucy sighed, a bit happy that Raymond had been searching for her. “I had to take a break Vic, it had been really rough recently and I needed some fresh air to wipe away my pains.” She swallowed.
“I understand but I have never seen my brother that worried. I know you love him, I have always known. It was so evident in the way you looked at him”.
Lucy looked away. “It doesn’t matter. He is going to be a father and I also can’t be with him under the circumstances”
Vicky breathed. “Ray told me everything Lucy. You can’t let Fred stand between you and the man you love. He caused a lot of havoc in our family too and partially caused the death of our parents, that is why everyone hates him so much”
Lucy was shocked. “What are you saying? Your parents died in a plane crash” she murmured.
“Yes. Fred arrived all of a sudden, claiming that our father had fathered him which my father confirmed. It brought a lot of rift in the family, especially between mum and dad but even when mum had forgiven dad and had her arms wide open to accept Fred, he was only intent on destroying the love in our family. Dad gave him a house in Abuja but still, Fred was so bitter. He did a lot of things and even set dad up in a hotel with a woman, got pictures and sent them to mum. It almost got them divorced. Thanks to the confession of the photographer, the situation was solved and we the children asked them to go on a vacation in order to forget the incident. That was when they were involved in a crash. It affected Ray a lot because he was the one that suggested that vacation. He was the closest to our parents. He was the one that even got them to accept me after they discovered my little secret, though, it took a long time”.
Luciana could not take in all she was hearing. “Wow” he breathed. Suddenly, she understood the painting she had seen. Fred was the shadow! She took a deep breath. “You have gone through a lot” she whispered.
“Ray has gone through more. He fought for me, neglecting his own problems. I would be extremely happy if you can make my brother very happy” she said.
“He had Tinuke and a baby to do that” Lucy said sadly.
“The baby is not his”
“What?”
“The baby Tinuke is expecting is for someone else”
**********
**********
The tension that Ray was feeling was enough to make him turn to alcohol but he did not. Ever since he met Lucy, everything in his life had changed. He had a cause to smile again. Discovering that he was not responsible for Tinuke’s pregnancy had relieved him of some stress but thinking about Lucy had almost drove him crazy. Fred had always been in the shadows of his life, tormenting him over and over again. How could he tell Lucy that he was in love with her? How would she take it?
He had damned the consequences and had gone in search of her but did not find her. He dropped the weight he was lifting and started running on the treadmill, this time, he did not see the ghosts that usually haunted him but he saw the angel that saved him from his ghosts. He saw the one woman whom he would love till his last breath.
He left the treadmill and picked up a towel, mopping away his sweat. “This room must be your favorite room”
Raymond rotated and his eyes met Luciana’s. He had thought about her so much that she had materialized in person. “Lucy” he breathed as his heart contrasted painfully in his chest.
Lucy tried to control her reactions as she stared at him but she couldn’t. He was standing bare-chested with sweat making his muscled body look moist and inviting. She altered her gaze and blinked. He looked tired and terribly sexy. He moved towards her and her heart pounded wildly. It took all her willpower to keep her feet rooted to the ground.
“You should put on a shirt” she murmured.
He grinned as he stood directly in front of her, too close for comfort. “Am I that appealing? I have been told that I am irresistible”
She lifted her eyes to his. “And you don’t hesitate in flaunting it”
“As long as it makes you notice me” he smiled and pulled her into his arms. “I have been going crazy in search of you, and you are right, this gym is one of my favorite places. This is where you gave me a calming kiss” he bent his head and took her lips urgently. He never knew that kissing a woman could make him feel so much. His heart pounded wildly as he cradled her face in his arms gently. Luciana held on to Ray feeling the uncontrollable joy that was so overwhelming. She felt so complete.
“I love you Lucy” Ray said, gazing into her eyes. She gasped. “Yes. I love you so much sugar. How could I not love the woman I found in a sack” he smiled.
Luciana was so happy that she jumped on him. “I love you Ray” he pulled her tighter and kissed her deeply. “So, I am the girl in the sack uhn?
“The sexiest one I have seen” he kissed her nose and they stayed there and talked endlessly. She told him everything about her past and he was terribly furious when she mentioned what Fred had done to her

_*EPILOGUE*_
Teju, Lucy and Ray sat in the sitting room of Lucy’s parents’ house. Her parents had travelled for some function and she missed them. She lay with her head on Raymond’s lap as she talked endlessly with him. Dana went to open the door when they heard a knock and Deolu entered. Teju saw him and her heart skipped. Luciana held her hand and squeezed. She had invited Deolu over, wanting Deolu and Teju to be as happy as she was with Ray. Deolu looked at Ray after greeting. “If Tinuke hadn’t been such an idiot, I would have said something nasty to you Ray”. Tinuke had gone to meet Tunde who was the real father of the child but he had denied responsibility and threw her out of his house.
“If you hadn’t left my sweetheart, I would have snatched her from you” Ray retorted, giving Lucy a peck. Lucy stood up and walked out of the house with Ray.
Teju stared at Deolu. It had been one month and she hadn’t set her eyes on him. He was looking extremely handsome in casual black trousers and a T shirt. “I figured you liked me better in casual wears”
“I like you in anything you put on.” She swallowed. She stood opposite him and when he tried to speak, she stopped him. “I owe you an apology Dee; I should not have behaved the way I did”
“I expected nothing less than that” he brushed away a stray hair from her face. “Anything is forgiven when you call me Dee”
“You might be sorry you said that in the future” she said when he took her in his arms.
“As long as you would be spending that future with me” he bent his head and kissed her deeply. He had wanted to do that for a very long time. No other thing felt so right or perfect. They held each other, both realizing that they needed the other as much as they needed their next breath.
“Are you planning to seduce me into accepting you?” Teju asked breathlessly.
He grinned. “As long as it makes you accept to be my wife”. Teju gasped. Deolu tensed as he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a tiny box and got down on one knee. Teju gasped as all their friends came out of the various rooms and Lucy entered the house back with Raymond. Suddenly, the house was filled with friends and family members. Teju blinked back tears but they came anyways.
“Teju, I don’t know any romantic word to say in order to soar your heart but I can promise to make you happy for the rest of your life. To put laughter on your face and to love you and you alone. Please be my wife Teju, please”
“Yes… Yes” she screamed and hugged him fiercely, kissing his neck in tears. He slipped the shinning diamond ring into her fingers and kissed her finger with the ring. The cheer in the room was deafening and chants of ‘kiss her, kiss her, kiss her…’ rang out on the large sitting room. Deolu pulled Teju into his arms and kissed her. They both forgot about the crowd and got lost in a world of their own. The kiss ended and they suddenly noticed that the room was dead silent. Teju was not surprised because she had known all along. The sitting room was dark except a spotlight which illuminated a painting.
Luciana gasped as she stared at herself. The painting was of her wearing the gown that Raymond had bought for her in the boutique. Everyone was struck by the mastery of the painting including Teju. Ray appeared and a spotlight captured him as he moved towards Luciana. “When I picked up a brush to paint again, only one image popped up in my mind. That Sunday, you had entered my room, wanting to drag me to church. I had pretended to be asleep and you stared at me longingly like you won’t mind joining me on the bed” everyone chuckled. Tears streamed down Luciana’s face. She never imagined someone painting her. “You had been so breathtakingly beautiful that I had taken my time to capture that image of you in my head, hoping that I would be able to paint again.” he got down on one knee. “Lucy, you gave me back my life and made me live again. You drove all my fears away and gave me love. I can’t spend the rest of my life without you; you sweeten my life; that is why I call you ‘sugar’. Please marry me Luciana Jones. I promise to never ever make you know a moment of sadness. I would be with you every time you need me. Please marry me sugar” his heart pounded against his ribs as he stared up at her with a sparkling ring in his hand. Everyone seemed to hold their breath.
Luciana knelt down, unable to control her tears. She wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug. He quickly pulled her slightly away from him. “Is that a ‘yes’ honey?”
“Yes” she screamed. “Yes… yes…” she continued to say until Ray silenced her with a firm kiss. The kiss was so tender and deep and demanding at the same time. They were both oblivious to the resounding cheers as they held on to each other. Vicky wiped off the tears in her eyes as she stared at the ring in her own fingers. She smiled up at Duke who hugged her protectively, when he noticed the eyes of some guys on Vicky. He kissed her head. Bose smiled at the couple. She was very happy for them. She had also found happiness in the arms of another man and her business was booming.
Lucy stood up and hugged Teju tightly. People started congratulating the two couples.
“I am happy for you Vic” Lucy said to Vicky.
“You said I would not have to try, guess what? I did not try a bit. Duke swept me off my feet”
Lucy laughed. “You deserve it”
“And you and Raymond are made for each other.”
Bose hugged Raymond. “I am glad you could make it Bose” Raymond said and she smiled.
“I would not miss it for anything in the world”
*****
Fred was sentenced to 35 years in prison and the two couples got married two years after on the same day.

27/06/2018, 17:20 - Nkechi Nwose: Nigeria Works!!!

Yes it does! Things actually work around here!

Yesterday afternoon, 18th of June 2018, my wife came back into the country through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport Lagos. On getting home we suddenly realised she left her hand Luggage at the airport - An unlocked and untagged hand luggage right in the middle of the floor in the baggage pick up area! The picture seemed so bleak. She was quite upset.

She immediately returned to the airport that same evening.

On getting there, she spoke to the airline staff on ground who had no idea what to do. she eventually ended up speaking to the FAAN Authorities.

They immediately went to the CCTV room but for some technical reasons, couldn't get to operate it. I thought to myself "what did I expect?!" That ended up being the wrong thought!

My wife was told to go home and that the operator would be summoned to come back. Quite sincerely, I wasn't too optimistic!

This morning (19th June 2018) however, my wife got several calls from the officials at the airport asking her to come around. She got there and they took her to the control room. They said they were up for a good part of the night going through the records. The found the frame they were looking for. They wanted her to see it too.

The recording in the airport showed a group of Chinese individuals who also came into the country about the same time. The bag in question was lying beside them. As they left, someone who was familiar with the Chinese guys spotted the unmanned bag and thought it belonged to them. He wheeled it towards them. By the time the CCTV showed them outside, the bag in question was now on top of their other bags.

The recording showed that the individual who took the bag to the Chinese had spoken to an immigration officer on the way out. They therefore went to look for the immigration officer in question and asked about the fellow. The officer remembered the man and knew him. He called him. They told him what had happened and that the bag indeed did not belong to the Chinese guys. This fellow then put a call through to the Chinese guys who said they were already in Ogun state attending a conference. The officials requested the bag be brought back immediately.

My wife was asked to wait. After a few hours, she decided to go home and come back. On her way home, she was called back that the bag had arrived and she had to come and identify all that was in it and be sure it was intact before the bearer would be allowed to go.

When she got to the airport, she checked through the hand luggage which had her jewelry bag, a wrist watch amongst other priced possessions. Everything was intact! They filed an official report afterwards about the incident had her sign and told her to go.

As if that wasn't impressive enough!

Like it's with our culture, my wife offered the airport official, A Mr Omoniyi Omotayo who had coordinated the entire recovery a 'thank you' token; He refused it! He told her he understood she was grateful but he was only doing his job! She didn't believe it! She thought the narrative he had given her earlier as to what they had to go through at night was to prep her up for the token. He refused still, he didn't even take a look at was he was offered. He assured her repeatedly that he was simply doing his job!

She initially felt bad that he didn't accept her token, then it dawned on her that perhaps, we are part of the problem when we offer people 'money' for doing their jobs. Each time we do that, we lay a precedence of expectation for others!

Its a cultural thing I agree, that's how we know how to say 'thank you'; but in so doing, we have also built a culture of entitlement! She recalled having a similar issue in Heathrow sometime ago and when she eventually located the bag, she didn't feel the need to 'offer' something but simply say thank you! So why is it different here?

I don't know what Mr Omoniyi's take home salary is; I'm not sure it is anything monumental; I suspect he has some pressing needs that could do with a 'token' but regardless, he chose rather to confer honour on the job he has been asked to do!

I'm excited to share this story! I'm excited to share stories like this!

It tells me things work! Regardless of what the pessimists and the cynics say or think; and Yes, we may not yet be there, we may still seem far off; but we are inching our way towards our desired outcome gradually! It might take years, but God helping us, we will get there! I am happy to celebrate this 'baby steps' with anyone that cares to listen!

So Yes! Nigeria Works!!! and No! we are not all corrupt! and it can only get better! All it takes is one Mr Omoniyi Omotayo at a time!

Kindly share if you will, let folks know Nigeria works! Let them know that the first point of entry into our country works and is getting even better!

Now this is my personal story, If you however have a story that shows us Nigeria Works! Please share with me and I'll be happy to share with all.

And if you have cause to pass by arrival section of the MMA anytime soon, its OK to ask for Mr Ominiyi and tell him that he is one of the shining lights in a country desperate for illumination!

May God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria! #NigeriaWorks

Why we, the Christians can't afford the schools built by our churches?

Pls help me tell *CAN* to Christianize Nigeria by opening interest free bank, free education, reduction of their university fee to 20,000 per semester. Tell *CAN* to start free distribution of Bibles all over Nigerian cities and villages. 

Tell *CAN* to abolish paying money before seeing G.O. Tell *CAN* to form and register a political party as it is done In Germany. 

Ask *CAN* where are they when Muslim started conducting white wedding?

 Ask *CAN* are they sleeping When Muslims started conducting vigils every Friday more than 10years ago?  Opened up camp ground for their crusade. 

Ask *CAN* where are they when their sons and daughters in various offices are being  used to bring anti Christian policies, was it not a christian who was used to sack all G. Os recently? Was it not Christians who cheer the merger of CRK/civil education?

Pls tell *CAN* to Christianize Nigeria!!

 Tell them to give Nigerians a better *LIFE.*

 Tell *CAN,* four of their Pentecostal churches alone can establish *MEGA BANK.* No, they won't do that because their priorities are competition of Jet acquisition, mega Cathedral, palatial auditorium. 

Ask *CAN* what is preventing them from establishing industries, farms, affordable schools to Christianize West Africa? 

Tell *CAN* to start formulating a new strategy to Christianize Africa. 

Tell *CAN* to stop talking and doing the same things the *OLD* way.

 Enough of Traditions, we need a *RADICAL* Change. Blessed be the *LORD JESUS CHRIST.* May His suffering on the Cross Never be in vain over Nigerian Christians. 

Pls post this until it get to *CAN, PFN* and other Christian Leaders in Our Land... God Bless you Too For Supporting The Truth.

Ask *CAN* where are they when their sons and daughters in various offices are being  used to bring anti Christian policies, was it not a christian who was used to sack all G. Os recently? Was it not Christians who cheer the merger of CRK/civil education?

Pls tell *CAN* to Christianize Nigeria!!

 Tell them to give Nigerians a better *LIFE.*

 Tell *CAN,* four of their Pentecostal churches alone can establish *MEGA BANK.* No, they won't do that because their priorities are competition of Jet acquisition, mega Cathedral, palatial auditorium. 

Ask *CAN* what is preventing them from establishing industries, farms, affordable schools to Christianize West Africa? 

Tell *CAN* to start formulating a new strategy to Christianize Africa. 

Tell *CAN* to stop talking and doing the same things the *OLD* way.

 Enough of Traditions, we need a *RADICAL* Change. Blessed be the *LORD JESUS CHRIST.* May His suffering on the Cross Never be in vain over Nigerian Christians. 

Pls post this until it get to *CAN, PFN* and other Christian Leaders in Our Land... God Bless you Too For Supporting The Truth.

*Man sees his dead wife living with another man in Lagos *
A man from Ezzagbo in Ebonyi state Okechukwu James Uwa who caused a heavy traffic today at Oshodi said he traveled to Lagos day before yesterday being 27th June 2018 to visit his one time colleague while he was in Aba, Abia state. And was parading along Oshodi when he stumbled on his wife that died two years ago in his home.
According to him, he said; my wife died of motor accident two years ago which I have finished her burial but am shocked to see her with a man who was conveying her in his motorcycle. At first, I hesitated until I summoned courage and when I called her by her name, on turning to see me she disappeared.
Our correspondent also said that the said man who was carrying her on his bike fainted twice before being resuscitated and narrated his own story saying that he have lived with her for 8months, he also said that she moved in with him after they met in a church and he dishing out advances towards her, I love her so much which I have begged to marry her. She told me she was all alone in Lagos working but told me she was from Ebonyi state. I have many times requested that I meet her people but she would decline saying that her people are evil'.

Chaai this world eeh, this is how I will be dreaming bad dream after eating fried rice without meat

02/07/2018, 18:11 - Oby Ezeh: *CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA HAVE FINALLY SIGNED THE CURRENCY SWAP DEAL*

*IT'S WORTH READING...*

*IN CASE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.*

  I know Most of You don't know the meaning of Nigeria dollars, yuan swap with China.. And why American government is desperately smoothing the relationship with Nigeria.

  Soon you will be buying that techno phone you bought at N80,000 for N12,000.

  The Central Bank of Nigeria have finally signed the currency swap deal we have been expecting for the past 2 years into existence with the Chinese government.

  The importance of this is that since almost 70% of the goods we import come from China and Asia and 12% America why must we use Dollars to transact with China? from now instead of using dollars at N350 to 1dollar to import those goods, we can now buy Yuan at 47 naira to 1 Yuan and import those stuffs directly.

  Instead of buying these goods in dollars in China, we will now buy them in Yuan which is 5times cheaper than dollars.

  As usual, another giant stride which Print Media, Electronic Media and Nigerian looters will not report or allow you to understand this victory over supremacy of dollars in our daily lives and economic activities.

  Up coming reality is that from tomorrow, try to monitor exchange rate. Some of those guys who hoarded foreign currencies to make gains will off load them in order not to have heart attack over their huge loss arising from the currency swap deal with china. 
Dollars and pounds will flood everywhere with no buyers, as the buyers will draw naira from their accounts in banks with presence in China. 

Many NIGERIA banks will be seeking to have their representative office in China  like first bank who saw to the future and already have office in China. 
Inflation will go down drastically because of the price of commodities that will drop.

When you die, don't worry.
Don't be concerned over your decaying body because people will take care of what is required.

*They will..
*1 - Buy you new white clothes
*2 - Wash you
*3 - Take you out of your home 
*4 - to your new place of stay (the grave)
*5 - Many will come to bid farewell at your funeral - in fact, many will cancel work for the sake of your burial, even though most of them didn't know you whilst you were alive.
*6 - Your belongings will be gotten rid of:
* your cars
* your check books
* your bags
* your shoes
* your clothes
* Your job, someone else will take your position*
* Your wealth will go to inheritors
* Whereas you will remain to be questioned about every minor and major deed
* There will be 3 types of mourners over you
* 1- The people who knew you only at face value will say 'poor man'
* 2- Your friends will grieve for hours or days but then return to laughter
* 3- The deep grief at your household will last for a week, two weeks, a month, 2-months or even a year

* And thereafter they will add you to their memories
* And so your story amidst the people ended
* And your story with the reality begins, *where will you spend Eternity?*
* And that is the life after death
* Indeed, the following things will leave you:-
* 1- Beauty
* 2- Wealth
* 3- Health
* 4- Children
* 5- The mansions
* 6- Your spouse
* And your real life has just started, *Eternity*.

The question here is....
*What have you prepared for your Eternity or hereafter?*
This reality needs to be thought over: Therefore 
*Take care of these two things ..*
*1- Salvation*
*2- Sanctification*
Don't forget your *Prayers*
*And don't forget to pass this message on to many...* Because once your  eyes closes in death, the only property left for you is *"your relationship  WITH GOD".*  
Where will you spend Eternity, *Heaven or Hell.* Let's all live a *holy life* my Brothers & sisters.

Please forward for evangelism..

The Devil told Eve the Truth, “You will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Gen 3:5); BUT he did not tell the Whole of the Truth that henceforth human mind shall be full of evil and their minds will be full of madness while they are alive, and afterward they die (Eccl 9:3; Matt 15:18-20). 
Knowledge is a gift of God Himself (2Chron 1:10; 1Cor 12:8) used to explore all of creation; for God has put everything in nature, it is for people to discover them (Gen 1:28-30). Human beings have since been in the process of discoveries. The question is, are the discoveries, - For Good or For Evil; - For Selfish interest or for the Good of All; - Praising God or Thanking Humans?
Knowledge have led to Pride and Egocentricism in some people that they say of themselves, “I am god” (Ez. 28:2-5). These are the results: 
•	Creation of Chemical/Nuclear weapons of mass destruction, - Imprisonment of a hungry thief and Freedom of Embezzlers and Political Robbers
•	Propagating immorality through the use of Computers, Telecommunications, Audio-visual and Internet
•	Promoting Abominations and sex with Animals (Lev 18:22-23; 1Cor 6:9), and Destroying Marriage (Divorce –Matt 19:6; Malachi 2:16); etc.
Remember, everything is permissible (allowable and lawful); but not all things are helpful or profitable. Everything is lawful, but we should not become the slave of anything or be brought under its power (1Cor 6:12; 10:23). Do not be deceived: "Evil Company corrupts good habits." Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. (1Cor 15:33-34; 3Jn 11-12). 
How do you use your knowledge?
May we be filled with the KNOWLEDGE and Love of God, and be able to promote what is good, profitable and righteous. 

Be Blessed

04/07/2018, 09:36 - Gladys Cyaa: 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣The topic for discussion this morning is *SURROGACY*
Surrogacy:Is a process whereby willing ladies are contacted by either couples or fertility clinics to help carry pregnancies on behalf of childless Couples. 
It often happens where married women find it difficult getting pregnant or where they have issues with their wombs. 
Through medical science, a couples sperm and egg are collected and fertilized and then implanted into the surrogate mother who in turn carries the pregnancy till it is due for delivery.
Surrogacy in Nigeria is so rampant that young ladies proudly advertise on social media of them being a Surrogate mother for couples. 
The question is 
1 _. What is the driving force for ladies into surrogacy?_ 
2.  _Is it not a conflict with our culture?_ 
3. __Will there not be discrimination against that child giving its birth circumstances._ 
4. _If the surrogate bonds with the child that has lived in her womb for 9 month even though her DNA is different from the child._ 
5. _How will the biological parent explain a sudden emergence of a baby in their lives._ 
_Let the discussion start. 🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀👯‍♀👯‍♀🏃‍♀👯‍♀

05/07/2018, 11:42 - Ify Ikeogu: I had left the house that morning refusing to pray together with my husband as we would usually do. We had a major fight the night before and none of us was ready to apologise. However, on getting to work, I became so uneasy. I couldn’t concentrate. Something was not right.

It wasn’t the first time we would have a quarrel; in fact, we’ve had more than I could count. But this uneasiness, I couldn’t seem to understand. I was pretty sure it was not about the fight, there was something more but I could not figure it out. 

I felt the urge to talk to him about this strange feeling so we could pray about it but… I mean, we’re still fighting and I was not ready to apologise. I mean, it takes a lot for me to apologise to him. 

I summoned the courage to call him during my lunch break but he didn’t pick up. I then sent him a message to check up on him, to which he didn’t reply. I expected that anyway, my husband would refuse to talk to me for days until I apologised. So, I decided I would apologise that night and we would pray about this strange yet stubborn feeling together. 

I got back home that evening still feeling uneasy, I made dinner and put the kids to bed. Just as I was about to relax, I heard my phone ring. On seeing it was my husband calling, I was so happy. I thought to myself, “Maybe he wasn’t that angry after all” thinking he was calling to let me know he was almost home as usual.

“Hello Love” I said as I picked up the call. “Hello, hello, is this John’s wife?” the caller on the other end asked. “Yes”, I replied quickly as I suddenly became really afraid. “Where’s my husband, what happened to my husband?” “He was involved in a ghastly motor accident, we are rushing him now to the General Hospital, please join us there as soon as possible” and the caller hung up. I was perplexed, confused, scared. I could literally feel my heart trying to escape out of my chest. Tears rolling d own my cheeks uncontrollably. Thoughts of horror flooded my mind. I hurriedly carried the kids into the car and zoomed off to the general hospital weeping and praying for my husband not to die!

On getting to the hospital, I heard the news. My worst fear had just happened! My husband of 7 years gave up the ghost before he was brought to the hospital. I almost ran mad! No it is not possible! I wish we didn’t have the fight last night. I wish I had apologised. I wish we had prayed. I wish he picked my calls earlier. I wish I prayed. The source of my strange uneasiness suddenly jumped out at me. My husband was no more! 

Dear reader, life is too short to live like Tom and Jerry. Your spouse will offend you; you too will offend your spouse, many times unintentionally. It is so easy to get caught up in the offense and hold grudges. This creates an opportunity for the devil to feast on your marriage. When you have done wrong, swallow your pride and admit your fault by apologising and moving on. If the other person is not willing to apologise, for your sanity and most importantly to make Heaven, let go and move on. Enjoy your marriage, enjoy your spouse, pray together, don’t let misunderstandings linger. 

If John and his wife were in good terms that morning, they would have prayed together, maybe just maybe the accident would have been averted.

This reminds me of the recent fire incident that happened in Lagos, Nigeria claiming several lives. Many of whom were returning home from school and work. So many evils are happening all around the world. No one knows tomorrow except God who owns tomorrow. You do not know when you will breathe your last breath. Why don’t you surrender your life to Him who can grant you life after the life here on Earth?  Accept Jesus into your life today and let Him give you peace in the midst of this stormy world we live in. If you wish to accept Him into your life, say this prayer genuinely:

Lord Jesus, please forgive me of my sins, I accept you into my life to be my Lord and Saviour, write my name in the Book of Life, and help me to make Heaven my home some day in Jesus name. Amen.
If you have said this prayer, congratulations! You are now born again. Please find a Bible believing church where you can learn more about God and His ways. 
God bless you!

07/07/2018, 12:05 - Nelson Cyaa: A very poor newly wedded,
young couple lived in a
small farm. One day the husband
made the
following proposal to his wife:
Honey, I will leave the house: I
will travel faraway,
get a job and work hard in order
to come back
and give you the comfortable
life that you
deserve. I do not know how long
I will stay away,
I only ask one thing, please wait
for me, and while
I am away, you should be
faithful to me, because
I will be faithful to you. His wife
agreed, so the
young man left. He walked many
days until he
found a farmer who was in need
of someone to
help him. The young man
offered his services. He
was accepted. Therefore he
discussed the terms
with his boss:
Let me work for as long as I
want and when I
think I should go home, please
relieve me of my
duties. I do not want to receive
my salary. I ask
you to save it for me, until the
day I leave. The
day I decide to go, please give
me the money and
I will go my way. They agreed
on that. So, the
young man worked for twenty
years without
holiday and without rest. After
twenty years, he
came to his boss and said:
Boss, I want my money, because
I am returning to
my home. The boss replied:
All right, after all, I made a deal
with you and I
will stick to it. However, before
you go I want to
offer you something new: I will
give you all your
money and send you away; or I
will give you 3
pieces of advice and send you
away. If I give you
money, you lose the 3 pieces of
advice. If I give
you the 3 pieces of advice, you
lose the money.
Now, go to your room and think
about your
answer. He thought for two
days. Then he went
to the boss and told him:
I want the 3 pieces of advice.
The boss stressed
again, if I give you the 3 pieces
of advice, I will
not give you the money, and the
man replied:
I want the 3 pieces of advice.
The boss then told
him:
No. 1: Never take shortcuts in
your life, shorter
and unknown paths can cost
your life. No. 2:
Never be too curious, for
curiosity towards evil
can be deadly. No. 3: Never make
decisions in
moments of anger or pain,
because when you
repent, it could be too late. After
giving these 3
pieces of advice, the boss said to
him:
Here, you have 3 loaves of
bread, 2 are for you to
eat during the journey and the
last is for you to
eat with your wife when you get
home. So, the
man went his way, after twenty
years away from
home and from his wife, whom
he loved so much.
After the first day of travel, he
found a man who
greeted him and asked:
Where are you going? He replied:
To a distant place which is about
20 days away if
I continue walking. The man said
to him:
Ol' boy, this path is too long! I
know a shortcut
that is very safe and you will
arrive in 5 days
only. The man began to follow
the path
suggested until he remembered
the first piece of
advice. Then, he returned and
followed the long
path. Days later he learned that
the shortcut led
to an ambush.
After a few more days of travel,
he found an inn
by the roadside, where he could
rest. He paid for
a room and after taking a bath
he lay down to
sleep. During the night he woke
up as he heard a
terrifying scream. He rose to his
feet and went to
the door to check what
happened. As he was
opening the door, he
remembered the second
piece of advice. Therefore he
returned, lay down
again and slept. At dawn, after
breakfast, the
owner of the lodging asked him
if he had not
heard the scream at night. He
affirmed that he
heard. Then, the host said:
Were you not curious to see
what happened? And
he replied:
No, I was not. Then the host said:
You are the first guest to leave
this inn alive. My
neighbour is completely crazy.
He usually shouts
at night to call someone’s
attention. When some
of the guests come out, he kills
them and buries
their bodies in the backyard. The
man continued
his long journey, eager to arrive
soon.
After many days and nights
walking, he was very
tired, but he finally saw his
house far away. It
was night. He saw some light
coming out of the
window of his house and was
able to see the
silhouette of his wife. But he also
saw that she
was not alone. He came closer
and saw there
was a man with her. She softly
caressed his hair.
When he saw that scene, his
heart was filled with
hatred and bitterness. He
decided to rush at and
kill them both mercilessly.
However, he took a
deep breath and he remembered
the third piece of
advice. Then he stopped,
reflected and decided to
sleep outside that night. He slept
in the midst of
the bushes, determined to make
a decision the
next day. At dawn, he was
calmer and thought:
I will not kill my wife and her
lover. I am going
back to my boss to ask him to
take me back. But
before I go, I want to tell my
wife that I have
always been faithful to her.
He went to the front door and
knocked. When his
wife opened the door and
recognized him, she
cried and embraced him warmly.
He tried to push
her away, but he
was not able. Then, with tears in
his eyes he told
her:
I was faithful to you but you
betrayed me.
She was shocked, so she replied:
How did I betray you? I have
never betrayed you.
I waited patiently for you for
twenty good years.
Then he asked:
How about the man that you
were caressing
yesterday? And she said:
That man is your son. When you
left, I discovered
I was pregnant. Today he is
twenty years old.
Hearing that, the man asked her
forgiveness. He
met and hugged his son. Then he
told them all
the things he had experienced
while away.
Meanwhile, his wife prepared
some coffee for
them to eat together, the last
bread given by his
boss. After a prayer of
thanksgiving, he broke the
bread. When he looked at it, he
found all his
money inside. In fact, there was
even more than
the right payment for his twenty
years of
dedication and hard work.
Friends, our God is like this boss.
When he asks
us to make a sacrifice, he wants
to give us more
than what we give Him. He
wants us to have His
unique wisdom as well as the
material blessings.

07/07/2018, 14:08 - figo: *I just read this story on how a daughter was raised and decided to share. A must read :* 

My Dad always *sounds* it in my ears "Simi, you must be *tough.* Being *girlish* and being *ladylike* is not an excuse for *weakness".* This he still says to all of us.

All the children were *raised* to do the *"masculine"* as well as the *"feminine"* tasks.

My sisters and I started *winding* a 15KVA generator as soon as we got one. I *learnt* how to wash a *car* (internal and external) before the *age of 16*.

I started *learning driving* immediately after *secondary* school. My Dad told me that before he allows me drive out *independently,* that I must learn to change *car tyres.*

I remember I was forming *ajebutter* and my Dad said to me "If you are *driving* on a lonely *highway* and you need to change your *tyre*, what would you do? You will have to get down and change it.... that's the *common sense* thing to do. It's a *survival skill* for drivers.

*My brother?*
He started *washing* the dishes as soon as he could reach the sink and *handle* the dishes. 

He started cooking *simple meals* before the *age of 10.* He started *washing* his socks and under wears before the *age of 7.*

He started *handling his laundry* before the *age of 11*, when he had to go to *boarding* school.

In my house, the rule was (still is) that *anyone who eats* must be able to get *involved in the kitchen*, when required.

My father tells me I can be *president,* not *first lady.* There is nothing wrong with being a first lady, but there's also nothing wrong with being the *husband* of the president. 

Thus, if you tell your *son* that he can be president, you should also tell your *daughter* that she can be president.

The *hidden but significant psychology* behind this is that telling your daughter that she can be president pushes her to be *great,*

*_while telling her that she can be a_* 
 *first lady* 
pushes her to aspire to marry a *great man,* 
and probably *reduces* the needed inspiration to aspire to exercise her maximum potentials.

We need not *teach our girls* to believe that the best they can be is to *exist under the success of a man,* their husbands.

It is *disfavor* to *humanity* to raise your son with the *impression* that he is better than other females.. 

Raise your daughters to understand that they are not *inferior to males.*

Teach your sons to be as *domesticated* as your daughters, 
_and push your daughters
to_
*attain financial independence* 
as much as you push your sons.

This way, we will raise a *less entitled*:
and *more responsible* generation, 
*equipped* with all vital survival skills, 
and with less *handicaps.*

*Charity* begins at *home*, not in the *offices* or *work places.*
 AND

*#Equality_Begins_At_Home*

Go tell it to the *world*, over the hills and everywhere

Keep Smiling!

What is this Country turning into..can't believe this is happening on the first day of the month 

They are now in lagos state oooo! This happened in someone's Estate this morning in Ikeja. A lady called an Aboki as we all call them, a shoe maker to help fix her slippers.
She allowed him stay in their compound, while she went back inside to continue with what she was doing.
When he was fixing her slippers, he added
something under before stitching it back. Luckily for the Lady, her landlord was at the balcony watching the ABOKI without his knowledge. When he was through, he called her to tell her that he has finished. She came out, he told her to try it on her leg to make sure it was OK.
Her landlord shouted from upstairs 'no oh,
don't put your leg in that slippers I'm coming. He came downstairs; forced the Aboki to put his leg in the slippers, the Aboki refused. Then he alerted neighbours. So, they all gathered, forced him to wear the slippers.
Immediately he put his leg in the slippers, Guess what happened??
Hmmmmmmmm !!!!!.
The slippers cut... He did not sew it well...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

ﻓﺮﺃﻯ ﻓﻘﻴﺮﺍ ﻳﻠﺘﻘﻂ ﺷﻴﺌﺎ ﻣﺎ ﻣﻦ ﺳﻠﺔ
ﺍﻟﻘﻤﺎﻣﺔ ﻓﺤﻤﺪ ﺍﻟﻠﻪ ﻭﺷﻜﺮﻩ ﺃﻧﻪ ﻟﻴﺲ
ﻓﻘﻴﺮﺍ*؛
  
The poor man looked
around and saw a naked
man misbehaving on the
street ... He said, Thank
GOD I'm not mad;

*ﻧﻈﺮ ﺍﻟﺮﺟﻞ ﺍﻟﻤﺴﻜﻴﻦ ﺣﻮﻟﻪ ﻭﺷﺎﻫﺪ
ﺭﺟﻼ ﻋﺎﺭﻳﺎ ﻳﺴﻲء ﺍﻟﺴﻠﻮﻙ ﻓﻲ
ﺍﻟﺸﺎﺭﻉ ﻭﻗﺎﻝ ﺍﻟﺤﻤﺪ ﻟﻠﻪ ﺃﻧﻲ ﻟﺴﺖ
ﺑﻤﺠﻨﻮﻥ*؛

The mad man looked
ahead and saw an
ambulance carrying a
patient ... He said, Thank
GOD am not sick;

*ﻧﻈﺮ ﺍﻟﺮﺟﻞ ﺍﻟﻤﺠﻨﻮﻥ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻷﻣﺎﻡ
ﻭﺭﺃﻯ ﺳﻴﺎﺭﺓ ﺇﺳﻌﺎﻑ ﺗﻘﻞ ﻣﺮﻳﻀﺎ
ﻭﻗﺎﻝ ﺍﻟﺤﻤﺪ ﻟﻠﻪ ﺃﻧﻲ ﻟﺴﺖ ﻣﺮﻳﻀﺎ*؛

Then a sick person in
hospital saw a trolley
taking a dead body to the
mortuary ... He said,
Thank GOD I'm not dead;

*ﻭﻣﻦ ﺛﻢ ﺭﺃﻯ ﻣﺮﻳﺾ ﻓﻲ
ﺍﻟﻤﺴﺘﺸﻔﻰ ﻋﺮﺑﺔ ﺗﻨﻘﻞ ﺟﺜﺔ ﺇﻟﻰ
ﺍﻟﻤﺸﺮﺣﺔ ﻓﺤﻤﺪ ﺍﻟﻠﻪ ﻭﺷﻜﺮﻩ ﺃﻧﻪ ﻻ
ﻳﺰﺍﻝ ﺣﻲ ﻳﺮﺯﻕ*؛

Only a dead person
cannot thank God;

*ﺍﻟﻤﻮﺗﻰ ﻫﻢ ﻭﺣﺪﻫﻢ ﺍﻟﺬﻳﻦ ﻻ
ﻳﺴﺘﻄﻴﻌﻮﻥ ﺍﻟﻜﻼﻡ ﻭﺷﻜﺮ ﺍﻟﻠﻪ*؛

Why don't you thank GOD
today for all your
blessings and for the gift
of life ... for another
beautiful day;

*ﻓﺒﻤﺎ ﺃﻧﻚ ﻻﺯﻟﺖ ﺣﻴﺎ ﺗﺮﺯﻕ ﻓﻠﻤﺎﺫﺍ
ﻻ ﺗﺒﺎﺩﺭ ﺑﺸﻜﺮ ﺍﻟﻤﻮﻟﻰ ﻋﺰ ﻭﺟﻞ ﻋﻠﻰ
ﻣﻨﻪ ﻭﻛﺮﻣﻪ ﻭﻓﻀﻠﻪ ﻭﻋﻠﻰ ﻫﺒﺔ ﺍﻟﺤﻴﺎﺓ
ﻭﻣﻨﺤﻚ ﻳﻮﻡ ﺁﺧﺮ ﺟﻤﻴﻞ*؛

​What is LIFE​?
To understand life better,
you have to go to 3
locations:
 
​ﻣﺎﻫﻲ ﺍﻟﺤﻴﺎﺓ؟​
*ﻟﻜﻲ ﺗﻔﻬﻢ ﻣﻌﻨﻰ ﺍﻟﺤﻴﺎﺓ،   ﺑﺼﻮﺭﺓ
 ﺃﻣﺎﻛﻦ٣ﺃﻓﻀﻞ، ﻋﻠﻴﻚ ﺑﺎﻟﺘﻮﺟﻪ ﺇﻟﻰ :
*

​1. Hospital​
​2. Prison​ 
​3. Cemetery​

​. ﺍﻟﻤﺴﺘﺸﻔﻰ١​
​. ﺍﻟﺴﺠﻦ٢​
​. ﺍﻟﺠﺒﺎﻧﺔ٣​

At the Hospital, you will
understand that nothing
is more beautiful than
HEALTH.

*ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﺴﺘﺸﻔﻰ ﺳﺘﺪﺭﻙ ﺃﻥ  ﻻ
ﺷﻴﺊ ﻳﻀﺎﻫﻲ ﻧﻌﻤﺔ ﺍﻟﺼﺤﺔ
ﻭﺍﻟﻌﺎﻓﻴﺔ*

 In the Prison, you'll see
that FREEDOM is the
most precious thing

*ﻭﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺴﺠﻦ ﺳﺘﻌﻠﻢ  ﺃﻥ ﺍﻟﺤﺮﻳﺔ ﻻ
ﺗﻘﺪﺭ ﺑﺜﻤﻦ*

 At the Cemetery, you will
realize that life is worth
nothing. The ground that
we walk today will be our
roof tomorrow.

*ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﻘﺒﺮﺓ، ﺳﺘﺪﺭﻙ ﺃﻥ ﺍﻟﺤﻴﺎﺓ ﻻ
ﺗﺴﺎﻭﻱ ﺷﻴﺌﺎ ﻭﺃﻥ ﺍﻷﺭﺽ ﺍﻟﺘﻲ
ﻧﻤﺸﻰ ﻋﻠﻴﻬﺎ ﺍﻟﻴﻮﻡ ﻭﺳﺘﻜﻮﻥ ﺍﻟﺴﻘﻒ
ﺍﻟﺬﻱ ﻧﻠﺘﺤﻒ ﺑﻪ ﻏﺪﺍ*؛  

Sad Truth* :  We all come
with ​Nothing​ and we
will go with ​Nothing​ ...
Let us, therefore, remain
humble and be thankful &
grateful to God at all
times for everything. 

​ﺍﻟﺤﻘﻴﻘﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﺆﻟﻤﺔ​: *ﻫﻲ ﺃﻧﻨﺎ ﻧﺄﺗﻲ
ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﺪﻧﻴﺎ ﺑﻼ ﻣﺘﺎﻉ ﻭﺳﻨﻐﺎﺩﺭﻫﺎ ﺃﻳﻀﺎ
ﺧﺎﻟﻴﻴﻦ ﺍﻟﻮﻓﺎﺽ*؛ 
*ﻣﻦ ﻫﺬﺍ ﺍﻟﻤﻨﻄﻠﻖ ﺩﻋﻮﻧﺎ ، ﺇﺫﻥ ،
ﻧﻈﻞ ﻣﺘﻮﺍﺿﻌﻴﻦ ﻭﻧﻜﻮﻥ ﺷﺎﻛﺮﻳﻦ
ﻭﻣﻤﺘﻨﻴﻦ ﻟﻠﻪ ﺳﺒﺤﺎﻧﻪ ﻭﺗﻌﺎﻟﻰ ﻓﻲ ﻛﻞ
ﺍﻷﻭﻗﺎﺕ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻛﻞ ﺷﻲء*؛

Could you please share
this with someone else,
and let them know that
God loves them ?

*ﻫﻞ ﻳﻤﻜﻦ ﻣﺸﺎﺭﻛﺔ ﻫﺬﺍ ﻣﻊ ﻣﻦ
ﺗﺤﺐ ، ﻭﺍﺷﻌﺮﻫﻢ ﺃﻧﻚ ﺗﺤﺒﻬﻢ ﻓﻲ
ﺍﻟﻠﻪ*؛

17/07/2018, 07:45 - figo: MARY IS THE MOTHER OF JESUS; IS JESUS GOD? I

Sometimes ago, I was reading through a booklet by the Jehovah Witness and I found this question: “Mary is the Mother of Jesus, is Jesus God?”  This question generated so much troubles within me that I began to question a lot of things not excluding trying to understand my belief about the person of Jesus Christ.

What does this question suggest? Though I did not continue the reading of the booklet, I could immediately guess where the question was directing.  Put it into simple logic:  There are three statements that can be derived from this simple question-like statement: Mary is the Mother of Jesus, is Jesus God?  


1.	  Mary is the Mother of Jesus
2.	  Jesus is either God or not God
3.	  Mary is either Mother of God or not Mother of God.

From the above, two things can be deduced:

A.	 

If Mary is the Mother of Jesus
And Jesus is God
Therefore, Mary is the Mother of God

B.	

If Mary is the Mother of Jesus
And Jesus is not God
Therefore, Mary is not the Mother of God

Then the question now is, IS JESUS GOD?

Be Blessed

17/07/2018, 07:47 - figo: MARY IS THE MOTHER OF JESUS; IS JESUS GOD? II

There have been controversies concerning the Person of Jesus from his childhood that Herod sought to kill him (cf Matt 2), his people did not believe him (cf. Matt 13:57-58; Jn. 1:11; Is. 53:3), his followers deserted him (cf. Jn. 6:60-66; Mk 14:50-51), the Sanhedrin rejected him (cf. Lk. 22:2), until he was put to death accusing him claiming equality to God (cf. John 5:18; 10:30-33; para Phil 2:6)

Though Jesus did not explicitly declare himself God (cf Jn 10:33-36) or equal to God (cf. Jn. 14:28; Phil 2:6), there are many statements he made, that were said of him, things done to him, and testimonies about him which show that He is God.

Jesus himself said, “I and the Father are one” (Jn. 10:30), “Before Abraham was, I am” (Jn. 8:58; cf. Ex. 3:14, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only." (Matt 4:10), --"Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades" (Rev 1:1-18; cf. Is 44:6). “You may ask ME for anything in my name, and I will do it” (Jn 14:14). “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." (Matt 18:20)

Of Him was said, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God…And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us…” (Jn 1:1,14); "For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form" (Col 2:9); “my Lord and my God” (Jn. 20:28)

He was worshipped by the Magi (cf Matt 2:11), the disciples (Matt. 14:33; 28:17); and was prayed to (cf. Acts 7:59; Rom 10:13-14); and in his name miracles happened (cf. Acts 3:6; 16:18; Phil 2:10).

He is the Second Person of the Holy Trinity – God the Son (cf Matt. 28:10

“To Him be all glory, both now and to the day of Eternity!” (2 Pet 3:18)

JESUS IS GOD MADE MAN – His divinity cannot be separated from his humanity (cf Jn 1:1,14; 1Jn 4:2)
17/07/2018, 07:49 - figo: Therefore THE VIRGIN MARY is the MOTHER OF GOD – as Elizabeth testified in the Spirit, “Why am I so favored, that the MOTHER OF MY LORD should come to me?” (Lk. 1:43)

“For nothing is impossible with God." (Lk. 1:37)

Be Blessed.

“One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” (Lk. 11:1-4) 
He said to them, “When you pray, say: 

“Our Father who art in heaven, 
Hallowed be thy name, 
Thy kingdom come, 
Thy will be done, 
On earth as it is in heaven. 

Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
As we forgive those who trespass against us. 
And lead us not into temptation, 
But deliver us from the evil. ’ (Cf Matt 6:9-13)


Why do some Christians add the text below and some do not?



“For Thine is the Kingdom 
The Power and glory 
Forever and ever. Amen”?

Be Blessed.

TO BE CONTINUED
18/07/2018, 07:03 - figo: THE LORD’S PRAYER  II

WHY THE DIFFENCE IN THE RENDERING OF THE LORD’S PRAYER?

It is not only the Protestants and the Pentecostal movements that add: 
“For Thine is the Kingdom 
The Power and glory 
Forever and ever. Amen” 

The Catholics do include this when they pray the “Lord’s Prayer” at Mass. This is called the Doxology (Short Hymn to end prayers. Cf. 1Chron 29:10-13). It may also interest you that it all depends on the translation of the Bible you are using. If you use the King James Bible or the New American Standard Bible for example, Matt 6:13 includes the Doxology while it is not included in some other Bible translations like the New International Version, the New Jerusalem Bible and the New American Bible.

The doxology, is generally considered to be a later addition to the text. Modern translations generally omit it as it is absent in the oldest and the best manuscripts of Matthew. Its first appearance was in a slightly shorter form in the “Didache” (The Teaching of Twelve Apostles – a first century manual of morals, worship and doctrine of the Church compiled around 130AD); an evidence that it might not have been original to the Gospel, though used during Mass and community prayers as at that time. 

The English version of the “Our Father” without the Doxology was mandated for use by Henry VIII (while still in communion with the Catholic Church). In 1541 (after his official separation from the Holy Father), Henry VIII issued an edict saying that all his loving subjects should learn and use the same English version without the doxology. This became accepted throughout the English speaking world. 

However, during the reign of Elizabeth I and a resurgence to rid the Church of England from any Catholic vestiges, the Lord's Prayer was changed to include the doxology. The Protestants thus pray the Lord ’s Prayer ending with the doxology while the Catholics maintain the tradition of the doxology used during the Celebration of Mass.

18/07/2018, 08:20 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: 25 LITTLE STORIES FROM THE UNKNOWN MAN


1. Once upon a time I met a man who told me that telling the truth and making someone cry, is better than telling a lie and making someone smile and happy. 

2. He said to me your true friends are those who will never avoid you just because they have met new friends. 

3. As he kept on speaking to me, he said If some people do not appreciate and value my presence, I should work hard to .make them value and appreciate my absence. 

4. He said I must not be angry with anyone who is quiet on me because there must be a reason why they are quiet, and that I will get to know the reason later. 

5. He told me it is always better to be a blessing to others at all times than to be a burden at all times. 

6. He said I must learn to forgive others not because they deserve it but because I deserve the peace that comes with forgiveness. 

7. I must know that everyone deserves a second chance and many more chances if they ask for forgiveness, but I must not loose my guard over their intentions. 

8. I must not only talk to people in my free time, but I must free my time to talk to people. 

9. I must know that the truth may hurt for a little while, but a lie will hurt for a long time. 

10. I must learn to value and respect people who tell you the Truth no matter how painful the truth is. 

11. I must make my decisions when I am in the right mood, not when I am angry, likewise I must not make promises when I am excited with high emotions. 

12. I must know that some people are like candles that burn themselves to give light to others. I should not have regrets if I happen to be one of such candles. 

13. I must learn to be a caring friend because it is a thousand times better than a careless lover. 

14. I should value and protect my relationships of many years of investments because they are like a book that takes years to write but can get burnt only within few seconds. 

15. He specifically said this repeatedly that If have a problem with someone, I should go tell the person and not go tell the world.

16. He said to me that I should know that nobody is too busy, it is just a matter of their priorities within a day. 

17. He said to me that people can trust you when you are consistent with what you say and what you do. 

18. He said with a low voice, only God can be totally trusted. Trust God 100%.

19. He then said no matter what, I must not forget those who helped and stood by me in my time of trials and during my difficult times. 

20. I must always remember those who turned their backs on me in my difficult times of trials. Not for vengeance, but for the lesson of life. 

21. I must be careful with those who put me into difficult times but I must never hate them. It is a lesson of life. 

22. He said again I must be grateful at all times to God for this life and for living. It is a previlege, and not a right. 

23. As he was leaving me, he said, always remember how temporary this world is, I must always be conscious of the reality of eternity with God in heaven or with Satan in hell fire. 

24. Be wise, you must respect your spouse, employer and the owner of your house or who gives you shelter.

25. He smiled and left waving me for a long time. Who must this man be? 

 God bless you more as you meditate upon these words.

19/07/2018, 07:34 - figo: THE LORD’S PRAYER  III 

WHAT FORM OF PRAYER DID JOHN THE BAPTIST TEACHE HIS DISCIPLES?

Obviously, prayer is part of Jesus’ life “but Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed” (Lk 5:16; Cf. Matt 14:23; Mk 1:35), except when he had to pray for people (Cf. Lk 22:32; Jn 17:1-26; Lk.) and sometimes with his disciples like at the last supper (Cf. Matt. 26:17-30). 

The request “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples” is thus very relevant and important for the disciples as they know that prayer connects one with God the father. But why reference to John the Baptist? 

There is no place in the Bible where a particular prayer is tagged “Prayer of John the Baptist” as one will find with “Prayer of David” (Cf. Psalm 17 or Psalm 86) or “Prayer of Manasseh” (Cf. 2Chron 33:19; Prayer of Manasseh 1). However, it will not be uncommon for John the Baptists like many other prophets or Pharisees or masters to teach his disciples how to pray (cf Lk.11:1) and how to fast (cf Lk. 5:33). That might involve, how, where, what and when to pray. And, of course, some of Jesus’ disciples were once the disciples of John the Baptist (Cf Jn 1:35-42) – for a disciple chooses his master. But we know that desiring to follow Jesus is not enough criteria to be his disciples. Jesus personally chooses his disciples and/or have to confirm them - For Jesus said "You did not choose Me but I chose you” (Jn 15:16; cf Matt 8:18-22). Yet one will expect Jesus to teach His disciples how to pray – But the only thing he demands of his disciples is to believe in him for He is in God and God is in Him (Cf. Jn 14:11)
19/07/2018, 07:34 - figo: Some people have argued that “The Lord’s Prayer” was originally prayer of John the Baptist. However, there is no such indication in the Bible or elsewhere in any ancient writings. Moreover, the disciple only asked to be taught how to pray as John taught his disciples, not that Jesus should teach them the prayer of John the Baptist. Jesus teaches us the best and complete prayer in “Our Father”

Pray it daily! 
Believe it!
Love it!
Mean it!
Act it!
And teach it in words and deeds.


Be Blessed

Can you get a picture of God laughing in the heavens? Right now, God is on the throne. He's not worried about the economy. He's not upset with you and me. What's He doing? God is full of joy and laughing on the throne. It goes on to tell us in Psalm 37 that He's laughing because "He can see the destruction of the enemy coming." In other words, the reason God laughs is because He knows the end of the story. He knows the final outcome. The good news is that you and I will win. God always causes us to triumph   That's what God is saying to us today. When it gets tough and things don't look like they're going to work out, we know with God, we are on the winning team! You can laugh with Him today knowing that He has favour, strength and victory for you in every area of your life!

21/07/2018, 13:24 - figo: GOD: MALE OR FEMALE? I

Genesis 1:27 states that “God created man in his image; in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them”, and Jesus said in John 4:24 that “God is Spirit” which has no body and no gender. How come God is referred to as MALE? In your own belief or opinion, is God a male or a female?

Talking about the gender of God rests on a lot of assumptions. There are as many religions as many varied religious beliefs about God. In fact, the last 40 years have witnessed hot debates about the language and expression in relation to God. The rise of the feminists which aims at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, cultural, religious, and social rights for women makes the opinion and ideas about God as male or female stronger. The feminists are of the opinion that the word “Father” for God should be expunged from theological and Christian religious vocabulary. They advocate a language that accounts for both male and female, rejecting the generic “MAN” as a synonym for human beings. Since human beings are created in the image and likeness of God, calling God "Father" and/or "Mother" will not be out of place considering the multifaceted nature of God.

Surprisingly, some Christians are of this opinion that God should not be addressed as Male even though Jesus called God “our Father in heaven” (Matt 6:19). It is most shocking when you hear some religious male and female at prayer replacing the word “man” or “men” with “us”, “people”, “men and women” etc as the case may be. 

Because the inspired writers of the Scriptures (Bible) were all men, they were said to be partial in making God male and projecting a female as inferior to a male.

 Will these be true?

 Is God really Male or Female?

Be Blessed.

21/07/2018, 17:49 - figo: THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE OTHER CATHOLIC CHURCHES - Read patiently!
(By Fr. Chinaka Justin Mbaeri, OSJ)

      Sometime around March 2018 (precisely a week to my priestly ordination), as I was about going for a retreat in preparation for my ordination, a friend sent me a write up of an anonymous author via WhatsApp trying to enquire about the veracity of its content. The article was titled: “MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN NIGERIA”. The write up which went viral was about the creation of a new Catholic Diocese in Ibadan, Nigeria (Eparchy of Our Lady of the Annunciation) of the Eastern Rites by Pope Francis on February 28, 2018, announcing Simon Faddoul as the first Bishop. Instead of the anonymous author to explain the different rites existing in the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, he/she went on to center on the priestly marriage under this rite, and this left many Latin (Roman) Catholics confused as to whether a priest can get married or not. Even the person who sent me the article was quite unhappy about the development; however, to me, the article made no difference from what I already knew and studied in Theology concerning the Rites existing in the Catholic Church. That aside, many people also were somewhat “scandalized” and some even vowed that they would leave the Catholic Church the day priests are allowed to marry. Sequel to this, I promised to come up with a clarification on the issue. Meanwhile, some authorities in the Catholic Church in Nigeria already responded to that article. According to the Archbishop Emeritus of the Catholic Archdiocese of Ibadan – His Grace, Most Rev Dr. Felix Alaba Job, “the write-up on the Maronite bishop is very shallow! It only dwelt on married/unmarried clergy. It did not tell us who are the Maronites?  How is an Eparchy organized?” Likewise; His Grace, Most Rev Dr. Gabriel Agbegunrin (Archbishop of the Metropolitan see of Ibadan), and also the Catholic Bishop Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) responded respectively on the issue, clarifying the faithful on the Maronites rite.
 
     As a follow-up, I intend to go beyond explaining the Maronite Catholics by clarifying the minds of the faithful on the different rites in the Universal (Catholic) Church in communion with Rome, together with their corresponding practices.
 
 It may sound weird to most people, (especially Roman Catholics) to know that there exist many rites in the Universal (Catholic) Church. Before delving into this discussion, it is pertinent to briefly explain what constitutes a rite. A rite could simply be understood as a Church tradition which indicates how the sacraments are celebrated. In other words, a rite is a liturgical, theological, spiritual, and disciplinary patrimony of a distinct people manifested in a Church. Put differently, each rite uses a distinct ritual for the Mass, the Sacraments and Sacramentals. These rites came about as a result of the Church’s attempt to evangelize the major cultural centres where it was situated in the first centuries so that the liturgy could be celebrated and best understood in these places without losing it essential form and matter. The cultural centres include - Alexandria in Egypt; Antioch in Syria; and Rome. In addition, with the influence of St. John Chrysostom and St. Basil, the Byzantine rite sprang up as a major rite from the Antiochian liturgical tradition.
 
     Today, we have 24 rites or Catholic churches: 
1 Latin/Western Church (Roman Catholic where the majority of us belong), and
 
23 Eastern/Oriental Catholic Churches with a more historical than geographical distinction. 

For a better understanding, let us consider a document of the Second Vatican Council on – DECREE ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCHES OF THE EASTERN RITE (ORIENTALIUM ECCLESIARUM), “These individual Churches, whether of the East or the West, although they differ somewhat among themselves in rite, that is, in liturgy, ecclesiastical discipline, and spiritual heritage, are nevertheless, each as much as the others, entrusted to the pastoral government of the Roman Pontiff, the divinely appointed successor of St. Peter in primacy over the universal Church. They are consequently of equal dignity, so that none of them is superior to the others as regards rite and they enjoy the same rights and are under the same obligations, also in respect of preaching the Gospel to the whole world (cf. Mark 16, 15) under the guidance of the Roman Pontiff.”

    Thus, it should be duly noted that all of the Eastern Catholic Churches are fully Catholic in that they recognize the timeless Tradition (with a big “T”) of the Catholic Church, such as the seven sacraments, the primacy of the Pope, the doctrine and dogmas defined by the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, and so on. Still, the Eastern Catholic Churches are exhorted to retain their own theological understandings of doctrines and to express it in the way they have received from their bishops and teachers of blessed memory. The Maronite rite which was established recently in Ibadan, Nigeria (springing from the West-Syrian or the Antiochian liturgical tradition) is an example of the Catholic churches of the Eastern Rite. Since they belong to the Eastern rite, their Eucharistic celebration is called "The Divine Liturgy", while we in the Latin rite call it "Holy Mass". With regards to participation in the Holy Mass/Divine Liturgy, the laity is typically encouraged to foster an appreciation of their own rite and is invited to stick to their rite; that is, observe that rite UNLESS there is a good reason, e.g. Latin-Rite Catholics living in an exclusively Byzantine Rite community/country, then one may participate in their Divine Liturgy. However, this does not mean that one cannot occasional or even, for a just cause participate in the liturgy of a different rite, either by invitation or the likes. 
  
 Having established this fact, it must be made clear that the Latin (Roman) rite and the Eastern rites have different traditions concerning clerical celibacy. Clerical celibacy was not originally the Catholic Church’s Tradition “ab initio”. It might interest you to know that it was introduced definitively into the Latin (Roman) rite in the 12th century. Put differently, the Church was over a thousand years old before it definitively took a stand in favour of celibacy in the Latin rite at the First and Second Lateran Council held in 1123 and 1139 respectively, when a rule was approved forbidding priests to marry. In 1563, the Council of Trent reaffirmed the tradition of celibacy. Celibacy is considered an important part of the priesthood, a sign of a priest's commitment to God and service; just as we see in 1Cor 7:32-33. Here St. Paul encourages celibacy, averring that an unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord; while a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife. While the Roman (Latin) Rite adopted the discipline of celibacy, the Eastern Rites continued with Priestly marriage and made celibacy optional. In this regard, the bishops of the Eastern rites are selected from the priests who opted to be celibates (that is, unmarried priests). In other words, a married priest of the Eastern rite cannot be a bishop. At this juncture, I believe we now understand why the Maronite priests are permitted to marry. This is because they belong to the Eastern Rite.
  
   Today, Roman Catholic (Latin Rite) priests are celibate. However, there are exceptions to celibacy in the Latin rite. We have the Permanent Diaconate. Here, a man is ordained a deacon permanently (he does not go on to become a priest), as such, he is given the option to marry.  If the deacon is to be married, his marriage must take place before his Diaconate Ordination. This is because the ordination impedes him from getting married; and once his wife dies, he cannot marry again. In addition to the exception, some Roman Catholic priests are married. These are former Anglican priests who came into the full communion of the Catholic Church and were accepted to ordination as Catholic priests. They either came in through what was called the pastoral provision (instituted under Pope St John Paul II) or through the “Ordinariate” established by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. These are Catholic priests. They are not some lesser category. They were granted a dispensation from the celibacy requirement.  
Let us bear in mind that this discipline of celibacy for the Latin rite is not a Divine Law, and thus, it could be changed by a Pope in the future; hence, do not be scandalized about this. Presently, there is a discussion that the Catholic Church may consider an additional exception to the rule of priestly celibacy. In those regions where there are too few priests and people suffer without adequate access to the Sacraments, the Church may consider inviting married men into the priesthood, provided they are devout, proven and mature. It was around last year 2017 when Cardinal Hummes reportedly asked Pope Francis to consider ordaining so-called “viri probati”, that is, married men of GREAT FAITH, capable of ministering spiritually to the many remote communities in the Amazon where there is a shortage of priests… In an interview with Germany's Die Zeit newspaper, the Pope said "We must consider IF “viri probati” is a possibility. Then we must determine what tasks they can perform, for example, in remote communities…” We are currently waiting for the outcome.

Having discussed these, let us take a look at the rites individually and know where they may be found.
 
(A) LATIN RITE/LITURGICAL TRADITION: 
1. ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH: 
Since the majority of us belong to this rite, I would not dwell much here. The Latin Catholic Church, is so large, however, that many people, even Catholics, are completely unaware of the existence of other rites. Here in the Latin rite, we are over a billion Catholics under the Supreme Pontiff (currently Pope Francis) as the visible head. If one is baptized in the Roman rite, he/she is called a Roman Catholic (not just a Catholic), because he/she was baptized under the Roman rite. Here, Latin is the official language used in the liturgies. The doctrine of the “Filoque” as contained in the Nicene Creed, has been the subject of great controversy between the Eastern and Latin Rite. The Latin term “Filioque” describes the Holy Spirit as proceeding from both the Father and the Son, (and not from the Father only). In other words, we profess in the In the Nicene Creed “I believe in the Holy Spirit….who proceeds from the Father and the Son…” (as contained in Scripture). For the Eastern rites, the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father alone (this too is given a strong theological and Scriptural support). There was so much contention over this issue that it contributed to what eventually led to the split between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches in A. D. 1054 – the Great Schism (East-West schism).
The Roman/Latin rite is present in the following Continents: Europe, Africa, America (North and South), Asia, Oceania, and Australia, with huge numbers of members in these regions (over one billion members). 
Now, let’s briefly consider our Eastern rites catholic brethren and their practices. 

THE 23 EASTERN CATHOLIC CHURCHES/RITES: 
The Eastern Catholic Churches are self-governing (sui iuris) particular churches in full communion with the Pope (full communion constitutes mutual sacramental sharing between the Eastern Catholic Churches and the Latin Church, including Eucharistic intercommunion), but they retain their distinctive liturgical rites, laws and customs, traditional devotions and have their own theological emphases. Terminology may vary: For instance, the term DIOCESE is used in the Roman rite, while EPARCHY is used in the Eastern rites (though, meaning the same thing); also, vicar general (for Latin rite) and protosyncellus (for eastern rites); likewise, confirmation (used in the Latin rite) and chrismation (for the eastern rites). In the eastern rites, the mysteries (sacraments) of baptism and chrismation are generally administered one immediately after the other according to the ancient tradition of the Church. Here, infants who are baptized and chrismated are also given the Eucharist (Cf. CCC 1233). The highest-ranking bishops in the Eastern rites are called Patriarchs. They do not believe in the doctrine of the Filioque. They have a stronger devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary; despite this, they believe that Mary was Immaculate only from the moment the Angel Gabriel appeared to her and the power of the Holy Spirit overshadowed her, and not from the moment of her conception. In other words, they reject the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of Mary which the Latin rite believes.  
Together with the Roman (Latin) Church, they make up the Catholic Church. The rites here are as follows:
 
B. ALEXANDRIAN LITURGICAL TRADITION
2. COPTIC CATHOLIC CHURCH – Situated majorly in Egypt
3. ERITREAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – majorly in Eritrea 
4. ETHIOPIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – majorly in Ethiopia

C. ANTIOCHIAN (WEST SYRIAN OR ANTIOCHENE) LITURGICAL TRADITION
5. MARONITE CATHOLIC CHURCH – situated majorly in Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Argentina, Brazil, United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and now in Nigeria – Ibadan.
6. SYRIAC CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, United States and Canada, Venezuela
7. SYRO-MALANKARA CATHOLIC CHURCH – India, United States.

D. ARMENIAN LITURGICAL TRADITION
8. ARMENIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Palestine, Ukraine, France, Greece, Latin America, Argentina, Romania, United States, Canada, Eastern Europe.

E. CHALDEAN (OR EAST SYRIAN) LITURGICAL TRADITION
9. CHALDEAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, United States
10. SYRO-MALABAR CATHOLIC CHURCH – in India, United States.

F. BYZANTINE (CONSTANTINOPOLITAN) LITURGICAL TRADITION
11. ALBANIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Albania
12. BELARUSIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Belarus
13. BULGARIAN GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Bulgaria
14. BYZANTINE CHURCH OF CROATIA, SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO (OR KRIŽEVCI CATHOLIC CHURCH) – in Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro
15. GREEK BYZANTINE CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Greece, Turkey
16. HUNGARIAN GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH - Hungary
17. ITALO-ALBANIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Italy
18. MACEDONIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – Republic of Macedonia 
19. MELKITE GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH – Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Jerusalem, Brazil, United States, Canada, Mexico, Iraq, Egypt and Sudan, Kuwait, Australia, Venezuela, Argentina
20. ROMANIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Romania, United States
21. RUSSIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Russia, China; currently about 20 parishes and communities scattered around the world, including five in Russia itself
22. RUTHENIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH (ALSO KNOWN AS THE BYZANTINE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES) – in United States, Ukraine, Czech Republic
23. SLOVAK CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Slovak Republic, Canada
24. UKRAINIAN GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH – in Ukraine, Poland, United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany and Scandinavia, France, Brazil, Argentina.

    From what we have seen thus far, it would be appropriate to indicate our rites when next we identify ourselves as Catholics. For example, I'm a Roman Catholic or I'm a Byzantine Catholic, and so on... 
Since after the great schism, it could be said that the Eastern and Latin rites are back to full communion. Under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (Canon 1 & 43), the Pope has supreme, full, immediate and universal ordinary authority in the whole Catholic Church, which he can always freely exercise, including the Eastern Catholic churches, and their leaders.  
Finally, the Latin and the Eastern rites (according to Pope Saint John Paul II) are the left and right lungs of the Catholic Church; thus, the Church must breathe well with her lungs. In all these, the Church remains One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. The differences in rites should not be understood as division.
Shalom!

(Kindly share with other Catholics you know)THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE OTHER CATHOLIC CHURCHES - Read patiently!
(By Fr. Chinaka Justin Mbaeri, OSJ)

      Sometime around March 2018 (precisely a week to my priestly ordination), as I was about going for a retreat in preparation for my ordination, a friend sent me a write up of an anonymous author via WhatsApp trying to enquire about the veracity of its content. The article was titled: “MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN NIGERIA”. The write up which went viral was about the creation of a new Catholic Diocese in Ibadan, Nigeria (Eparchy of Our Lady of the Annunciation) of the Eastern Rites by Pope Francis on February 28, 2018, announcing Simon Faddoul as the first Bishop. Instead of the anonymous author to explain the different rites existing in the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, he/she went on to center on the priestly marriage under this rite, and this left many Latin (Roman) Catholics confused as to whether a priest can get married or not. Even the person who sent me the article was quite unhappy about the development; however, to me, the article made no difference from what I already knew and studied in Theology concerning the Rites existing in the Catholic Church. That aside, many people also were somewhat “scandalized” and some even vowed that they would leave the Catholic Church the day priests are allowed to marry. Sequel to this, I promised to come up with a clarification on the issue. Meanwhile, some authorities in the Catholic Church in Nigeria already responded to that article. According to the Archbishop Emeritus of the Catholic Archdiocese of Ibadan – His Grace, Most Rev Dr. Felix Alaba Job, “the write-up on the Maronite bishop is very shallow! It only dwelt on married/unmarried clergy. It did not tell us who are the Maronites?  How is an Eparchy organized?” Likewise; His Grace, Most Rev Dr. Gabriel Agbegunrin (Archbishop of the Metropolitan see of Ibadan), and also the Catholic Bishop Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) responded respectively on the issue, clarifying the faithful on the Maronites rite.
 
     As a follow-up, I intend to go beyond explaining the Maronite Catholics by clarifying the minds of the faithful on the different rites in the Universal (Catholic) Church in communion with Rome, together with their corresponding practices.
 
 It may sound weird to most people, (especially Roman Catholics) to know that there exist many rites in the Universal (Catholic) Church. Before delving into this discussion, it is pertinent to briefly explain what constitutes a rite. A rite could simply be understood as a Church tradition which indicates how the sacraments are celebrated. In other words, a rite is a liturgical, theological, spiritual, and disciplinary patrimony of a distinct people manifested in a Church. Put differently, each rite uses a distinct ritual for the Mass, the Sacraments and Sacramentals. These rites came about as a result of the Church’s attempt to evangelize the major cultural centres where it was situated in the first centuries so that the liturgy could be celebrated and best understood in these places without losing it essential form and matter. The cultural centres include - Alexandria in Egypt; Antioch in Syria; and Rome. In addition, with the influence of St. John Chrysostom and St. Basil, the Byzantine rite sprang up as a major rite from the Antiochian liturgical tradition.
 
     Today, we have 24 rites or Catholic churches: 
1 Latin/Western Church (Roman Catholic where the majority of us belong), and
 
23 Eastern/Oriental Catholic Churches with a more historical than geographical distinction. 

For a better understanding, let us consider a document of the Second Vatican Council on – DECREE ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCHES OF THE EASTERN RITE (ORIENTALIUM ECCLESIARUM), “These individual Churches, whether of the East or the West, although they differ somewhat among themselves in rite, that is, in liturgy, ecclesiastical discipline, and spiritual heritage, are nevertheless, each as much as the others, entrusted to the pastoral government of the Roman Pontiff, the divinely appointed successor of St. Peter in primacy over the universal Church. They are consequently of equal dignity, so that none of them is superior to the others as regards rite and they enjoy the same rights and are under the same obligations, also in respect of preaching the Gospel to the whole world (cf. Mark 16, 15) under the guidance of the Roman Pontiff.”

    Thus, it should be duly noted that all of the Eastern Catholic Churches are fully Catholic in that they recognize the timeless Tradition (with a big “T”) of the Catholic Church, such as the seven sacraments, the primacy of the Pope, the doctrine and dogmas defined by the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, and so on. Still, the Eastern Catholic Churches are exhorted to retain their own theological understandings of doctrines and to express it in the way they have received from their bishops and teachers of blessed memory. The Maronite rite which was established recently in Ibadan, Nigeria (springing from the West-Syrian or the Antiochian liturgical tradition) is an example of the Catholic churches of the Eastern Rite. Since they belong to the Eastern rite, their Eucharistic celebration is called "The Divine Liturgy", while we in the Latin rite call it "Holy Mass". With regards to participation in the Holy Mass/Divine Liturgy, the laity is typically encouraged to foster an appreciation of their own rite and is invited to stick to their rite; that is, observe that rite UNLESS there is a good reason, e.g. Latin-Rite Catholics living in an exclusively Byzantine Rite community/country, then one may participate in their Divine Liturgy. However, this does not mean that one cannot occasional or even, for a just cause participate in the liturgy of a different rite, either by invitation or the likes. 
  
 Having established this fact, it must be made clear that the Latin (Roman) rite and the Eastern rites have different traditions concerning clerical celibacy. Clerical celibacy was not originally the Catholic Church’s Tradition “ab initio”. It might interest you to know that it was introduced definitively into the Latin (Roman) rite in the 12th century. Put differently, the Church was over a thousand years old before it definitively took a stand in favour of celibacy in the Latin rite at the First and Second Lateran Council held in 1123 and 1139 respectively, when a rule was approved forbidding priests to marry. In 1563, the Council of Trent reaffirmed the tradition of celibacy. Celibacy is considered an important part of the priesthood, a sign of a priest's commitment to God and service; just as we see in 1Cor 7:32-33. Here St. Paul encourages celibacy, averring that an unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord; while a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife. While the Roman (Latin) Rite adopted the discipline of celibacy, the Eastern Rites continued with Priestly marriage and made celibacy optional. In this regard, the bishops of the Eastern rites are selected from the priests who opted to be celibates (that is, unmarried priests). In other words, a married priest of the Eastern rite cannot be a bishop. At this juncture, I believe we now understand why the Maronite priests are permitted to marry. This is because they belong to the Eastern Rite.
  
   Today, Roman Catholic (Latin Rite) priests are celibate. However, there are exceptions to celibacy in the Latin rite. We have the Permanent Diaconate. Here, a man is ordained a deacon permanently (he does not go on to become a priest), as such, he is given the option to marry.  If the deacon is to be married, his marriage must take place before his Diaconate Ordination. This is because the ordination impedes him from getting married; and once his wife dies, he cannot marry again. In addition to the exception, some Roman Catholic priests are married. These are former Anglican priests who came into the full communion of the Catholic Church and were accepted to ordination as Catholic priests. They either came in through what was called the pastoral provision (instituted under Pope St John Paul II) or through the “Ordinariate” established by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. These are Catholic priests. They are not some lesser category. They were granted a dispensation from the celibacy requirement.  
Let us bear in mind that this discipline of celibacy for the Latin rite is not a Divine Law, and thus, it could be changed by a Pope in the future; hence, do not be scandalized about this. Presently, there is a discussion that the Catholic Church may consider an additional exception to the rule of priestly celibacy. In those regions where there are too few priests and people suffer without adequate access to the Sacraments, the Church may consider inviting married men into the priesthood, provided they are devout, proven and mature. It was around last year 2017 when Cardinal Hummes reportedly asked Pope Francis to consider ordaining so-called “viri probati”, that is, married men of GREAT FAITH, capable of ministering spiritually to the many remote communities in the Amazon where there is a shortage of priests… In an interview with Germany's Die Zeit newspaper, the Pope said "We must consider IF “viri probati” is a possibility.

22/07/2018, 16:15 - figo: GOD: MALE OR FEMALE? II

The idea of God being male or female rests first on one’s belief about God. The gender of God can be seen literally or allegorically. In polytheistic religions, the gods are viewed to have literal sexual genders – male and female; hence gods and goddess - which would enable them to have sexual interaction with each other, as well as with humans. However, in most monotheistic religions, God is one and there is no other (Ex 8:10; Deut 3:35; Is 44:6; 1 Cor 8:4; 1Tim 2:5). Because he is ONE, sexual connotation as regards the Being of God will be futile. God is Spirit (Jn 4:24). 

Some Christian religious groups have started altering their views on/and the language used to express the views of God. Take for instance, the “Inclusive Language Lectionary” produced by the United States of America Council of Churches reflects Jesus Christ’s word for God “ABBA FATHER” has been changed to “ABBA FATHER AND MOTHER” and Christ’s relationship with God as a ‘SON” has been changed to “CHILD”. The Methodist Church in its 1992 Annual Conference in Great Britain concluded that the use of female imagery is compatible with faithfulness to Scripture and that in order to avoid distortion of our image of God, both female and male images should be used to refer to Him/Her (Inclusive Language and Imagery about God, 1992). 

The few questions are: 

- If God is genderless Spirit, why did both the Old Testament and the New Testament use masculine pronouns – Him, His, He - to refer to God?

- Is the Bible no longer considered Inspired? (Cf. 2Tim 3:16-17)

- Is Jesus’ calling God His Father an error? (Cf. Matt 12:50)

Be Blessed.

This question, considering the different religions, is a big question that will lead to endless debates based on various views and beliefs for no one has seen God (Cf Jn 1:18; 1Cor 2:9).  However, if a Christian is raising such question after Jesus Christ has revealed God to us as a "Father" - there comes a fundamental question if such Christian or Church that challenges the Scriptures is really and truly Christian.

It is true that God is Spirit (Jn 4:24) and cannot be thought of as human. It is also true that when the Scriptures talks about man being created in the image and likeness of God in Gen 1:26-27, the image and likeness here isn't in form of physical appearance as man. And of course human beings are limited in the language to qualify the Being of God - for God is bigger than everything. Though Jesus reveal to us God has a father, one will fall into the error of anthropormorphism if one thinks of God being father in human form - meaning the "Fatherhood" of God, the First Person of the Holy Trinity, is relational and not structural/somatic. Did God give birth to any of us? Yet God is seen as the Father of us all (Cf. Jn 1:12; Malachi 2:10): God is not referred to as Grandfather or Great-grandfather, and not our ancestor - but Father in its real and ideal state in a relational form. And it will be out of sense calling God our Father a female or using feminine gender for Him. Yet God is not a man.

There are times the scripture expresses God's nature as best Mother, for example, Isaiah 49:15 says: “Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you". This does not make God a woman just as calling God Father does not make Him a man. He is God! 

Someone asks, "If God is a male, and Jesus is a male, what gender is the Holy Spirit?


Be Blessed

God is God who is neither a man nor a woman; Yet He is the Father Almighty, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, of all things visible and invisible. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and our Father also (Jn 20:17). Because God is revealed to us by His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, as a Father, it is only logical and sensible and it follows that masculine gender be attributed to Him. This does not in any way make Him a man. 

Holy Spirit also has masculine representation hence the Latin word, SPIRITUS. If the First two Persons of the Holy Trinity (Father and Son) are of masculine gender, it is only logical that the Third Person of the Holy Trinity (Holy Spirit) be so represented (cf. In 14:26, ESV). 

Christians need to be careful in following the dictates of the world. Believing the Sacred Scriptures and the teachings of the Church is a pathway to the Divine Truth. Do not be deceived by the way of the world which is ruled by the Devil (Cf. Jn 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) rather be guided by the Word of God and the teachings of His Church (Cf. Rom 16:17-20).

There is nothing wrong to fight for equal gender treatment but it is absurd to think of a man as a woman, or a man wanting to be called a woman. And of course the faith is questionable of any Christian who denies the Fatherhood of God.

Remember, "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness" (2Tim 3:16) and “All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up" (1Cor 10:23).

May God our Father Bless you with every good thing, through His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, in the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Be Blessed.

SPORTS!

Sports Are Not only play, But Are a way to evangelize Teens and Youths; and the relations between them and their local Parishes. Sports has a significant impact on Youths and Teens. Thanks to God this is a trend in some Parishes or Schools. Nevertheless Church/Youth Leaders should strengthen their steps in this direction. Many Teens are engaged in sports or follow 'Stars' as fans, as we witnessed with the last World Cup. Apart from the spiritual food we feed them our Teens and Youths also needed time for play and recreation. Some Christians regard sports as trivia and associate it with sin as such do not allocate time for it within their year plan.

Genuinely engaging our Young ones in Sports within the Parish has Positive Consequences: 

. It's a means to scholarship or Career in elite level or professional sports
. Many of if them discover and specialise in one sports at a very young age and improve year round in that field.
. Sports can be a context within which the young can grow in virtues. In the process of playing, they can become more temperate, kind, alert, prudent, courageous, and exercise moderation with respect to their appetites in general.

SPORTS for our youth and Teens is a solid human foundation with which God's grace can work.

Here are some sports facilities you can try out within or out of the church premises

Chess🎛

Monopoly🚺
Card Games 🚸

25/07/2018, 09:20 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: We will look at two councils today:
-The First Council of Nicaea 
-The Council of Trent
25/07/2018, 09:21 - ‪+234 803 695 0694‬: ok
25/07/2018, 09:26 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Starting with Nicaea (325 AD)
There was this misconception that the son of Man didn't exist from the beginning of time, but created. Which doesn't correlate John: 1 vs 1
25/07/2018, 09:28 - figo: I dey hia...but in transit
25/07/2018, 09:28 - figo: Will join in later...una welldone
25/07/2018, 09:29 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: First Council of Nicaea (325 A.D.)

   -Arianism – the belief that the Son of God did not always exist, but was created by—and is therefore distinct from—God the Father. The First Council of Nicaea declared this belief heretical, as did the First Council of Constantinople.


  -Easter date – the date for celebrating Easter was chosen so as not to conflict or be on the same day as the Jewish Passover.


  -Meletius of Lycopolis – bishop of Lycopolis in Egypt. Founder and namesake of the Melitians, who refused to receive in communion those Christians who had renounced their faith during the persecution and later repented of that choice.


  -Nicene Creed – the declaration of the faith of the church


  -Canon Law – body of laws, regulations, or disciplines made or adopted by ecclesiastical authority. 20 were issued by this Council, including several addressing the primacy of Roman, Antochian, and Alexandrian patriarchs

25/07/2018, 09:33 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: We can break it down
25/07/2018, 09:33 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: 😂😂
25/07/2018, 09:35 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Nicaea is the name of the First Ecumenical Council if the church, and it was called for reasons which include Arianism
25/07/2018, 09:35 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Arianism is coined from a Christian Presbyter called Arius
25/07/2018, 09:36 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: His teachings were based on the fact that Son is begotten of the Father, but wasn't in existence with the father ab initio (I.e from the beginning of time)
25/07/2018, 09:38 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: The church had site down in a council to correct that notion, this is so we know that all the mentalities of people we hear...here and there didn't start today...but e Don taay😃

25/07/2018, 09:46 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Nicene Creed is named after the city of Nicaea whee the first ecumenical council took place
25/07/2018, 09:46 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: And the Creed is what we say every Sunday...."We believe in one God...father almighty.......
25/07/2018, 09:46 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: U are blessed
25/07/2018, 09:47 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: This Creed was structured to counter the Arianism belief
25/07/2018, 09:48 - Henry Osah: 🙌
25/07/2018, 09:49 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: Is this *whee* was it meant to be *where* sir?
25/07/2018, 09:49 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: That's why we hear: *"And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father;"*
25/07/2018, 09:49 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Yes it's where

25/07/2018, 09:56 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Who is also one in substance with the father...in our today's text it has been revised to *"co-substantial with the father"*
25/07/2018, 09:57 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Meaning that, they are of the same substance and they are one😊

25/07/2018, 15:38 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: Good afternoon all



Please Rosemary, does it mean that the *Council of Tent* is no more on existence since the year specified 1545-1563🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
25/07/2018, 15:44 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: The year specified is the duration of the council meeting
25/07/2018, 15:44 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: It is similar to what is called 'Synod' in Nigeria
25/07/2018, 15:44 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Synod is a meeting of all the bishops to decide particular issues with a country or a state
25/07/2018, 15:45 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: E.g when we were asked not to shake ourselves during the 'Peace of Christ' when there was Ebola outbreak. This is part of the things decided by the Synod
25/07/2018, 15:48 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Synod or ecumenical council meetings can last a year...two years or 5years
25/07/2018, 15:48 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: It's not like CYAA meeting or Parish Council meeting 😄😄😄
25/07/2018, 16:03 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: Please kindly throw more light on this👆👆👆
25/07/2018, 16:04 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: 👏 it was an error. Disregard

25/07/2018, 16:07 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: <Media omitted>
25/07/2018, 16:08 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Sorry, that's council of Ephesus and the topic will be discussed 2moro
25/07/2018, 16:09 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Council of Trent (1545–1563, with interruptions)

  -Protestantism – one of the major groupings within Christianity. It has been defined as "any of several church denominations denying the universal authority of the Pope and affirming the Reformation principles of justification by faith alone, the priesthood of all believers, and the primacy of the Bible as the only source of revealed truth" and, more broadly, to mean Christianity outside "of a Catholic or Eastern church". This set of beliefs was condemned by the Council of Trent.

  -indulgences – indulgence is the full or partial remission of temporal punishment due for sins which have already been forgiven. The Council of Trent curtailed and restricted how they are issued.


  -sola fide – Protestant doctrine of "faith alone." The Council of Trent rejected this doctrine as "vain confidence."


  -Canon of Trent – confirmed that the deuterocanonical books were on a par with the other books of the canon; ended debate on the Antilegomena; coordinated church tradition with the Scriptures as a rule of faith. It also affirmed Jerome's Latin translation, the Vulgate, to be authoritative for the text of Scripture

  -sacraments – sacred rite recognized as of particular importance and significance; the Council of Trent reaffirmed seven sacraments.


  -purgatory – condition of purification or temporary punishment by which those who die in a state of grace are believed to be made ready for Heaven. The Council of Trent affirmed this doctrine.
25/07/2018, 16:10 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: 💪👍
25/07/2018, 16:36 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: 👍👍👍
25/07/2018, 16:37 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: Catechism throw back
25/07/2018, 16:41 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: Why is it "vain Confidence" for someone to have *Faith Alone* because I noticed the Council of Trent rejected it. Any further explanation🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
25/07/2018, 16:56 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Other churches especially the prostentants believe in The doctrine of sola fide in that God's pardon for guilty sinners is granted to and received through faith alone, excluding all "works".
25/07/2018, 16:57 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: In catholic church we believe in Faith and Opus Dei (God's work). Actions and activities are part of our faith and salvation
25/07/2018, 17:03 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: But faith is a personal adherence of the whole man to God who reveals Himself. It involves an assent of the intellect and will to the self-revelation God has made through His deeds and words.... What then actions and activities one need to have His/Her sins pardon by God?
25/07/2018, 17:10 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: Faith and works go along
25/07/2018, 17:12 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: Penance, Abstinence, confession and faith
25/07/2018, 17:15 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: Good one
25/07/2018, 17:17 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: The thing is this
25/07/2018, 17:18 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Protestants believe that salvation is granted to an individual once the person is baptized in faith
25/07/2018, 17:19 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Meaning that as long as you are baptized, heaven Don sure for you
25/07/2018, 17:20 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: But we catholics don't just believe in *initial justification* (baptism) but also in striving to do God's will which are the *works* (sanctification)
25/07/2018, 17:21 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Broadly speaking, Catholic, Methodist and Orthodox Christians distinguish between initial justification, which in their view ordinarily occurs at baptism, and final salvation, accomplished after a lifetime of striving to do God's will (sanctification).
25/07/2018, 17:22 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Catholics believe faith as is active in charity and good works (fides caritate formata) can justify man, Protestants believe faith without works can justify man because Christ died for sinners, but that anyone who truly has faith will produce good works as a product of faith, as a good tree produces good fruit.

25/07/2018, 19:15 - Ify Ikeogu: Thanks for this topic. Really learning a lot. 
Seeing the reason am better of a Catholic than a Protestant. 

If they believed in Bible  alone what happen to things not in the Bible , that can be found in the tradition. 
 
Bible are written down but from tradition  being given to us, which they omitted some others things. So I think the Trent are in order.

26/07/2018, 10:59 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: First Council of Ephesus (431 A.D.)

  -Nestorius – teachings included rejection of the long-used title of Theotokos ("Mother of God") for the Virgin Mary, and were understood by many to imply that he did not believe that Christ was truly God. The Council formally condemned him and his followers for heresy.
 -Nestorianism – emphasizes the disunion between the human and divine natures of Jesus.


  -Caelestius – major follower of the Christian teacher Pelagius and the Christian doctrine of Pelagianism, which was opposed to Augustine of Hippo and his doctrine in original sin, and was later declared to be heresy. He and his followers were declared heretics during this council.


  -Nicene Creed – the declaration of the faith of the church - confirmed. Departure from the creed decreed as heretical.

 -excommunication – eviction from the church. This was the punishment decreed at this council for those who did not accept Church doctrine


  -The Virgin Mary – Mary, mother of Jesus. This council decreed she is to be called Theotokos (God-bearer)

Only at Cardinal stage you are given the title "prince of the church" truth is, during the whole duration from priest to Cardinal....you must have gone through a lot of experience from heading a Parish, to heading a diocese or archdiocese as case may be...you will have advanced in various studies etc. You must have been very learned and the Learning process takes years of experience.

26/07/2018, 18:25 - figo: WHO IS A BISHOP?

A bishop is given to the Church by Christ to act as a shepherd of a "Diocese". He should be an ordained priest; above reproach, sober- minded, self- controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and not a lover of money (Cf. 1Tim 3:2-3). According to canon 378 §1, a bishop should at least be 35 years old and a priest for at least 5 years, he should be "outstanding in strong faith, good morals, piety, zeal for souls, wisdom, prudence and human virtues"; and he should be well versed in sacred Scripture, theology and canon law and, preferably, hold a doctorate in one of these fields. He is a superior to all the priests (except those belonging to religious orders) in his diocese. 

How is the bishop appointed? 

There are four stages involved in the appointment of a bishop.

STAGE 1: Every 5 years, the bishop of a particular diocese submits "Terna" I.e the names of three priests he judges suitable for the office of a bishop. These names may be submitted to the Archbishop of the province (sometimes annually)

STAGE 2: At the time of vacancy, the 'Terna' is submitted by the Archbishop to the Apostolic Nuncio (Pope's Representative) to the Country, who makes confidential investigations and approximately 20 Pages reports of the investigation from 20 to 30 people including bishops, priests, religious and laity. He also make recommnendations to the Congregation of Bishops (Roman Curia).

STAGE 3: Among the Congregation of Bishops, a cardinal relator is chosen to summarize the documentation and make a report to the full congregation, the congregation discusses the appointment and then votes. The Congregation may follow the recommendation of the nuncio, chose another of the candidates on the terna, or even ask that another terna be prepared.
26/07/2018, 18:27 - figo: STAGE 4: The recommendation of the congregation is submitted to the Pope who now communicates his prayerful decision to the prefect of the congregation. The decision is now communicated to the nuncio, who in turn contacts the candidate and asks if he will accept. If he answers "yes," the Vatican is notified and a date is set for the announcement.


May the Lord continues to guide His Church with His Holy Spirit, as we continue to pray for our Bishops.

Be Blessed.

Someone commented, 

"Thank you for this post (WHO IS A BISHOP?), you might not remembered I asked you the question you now answered this morning years ago!
"But the majority of the bishops had one time or the other studied for a longer time in Rome, you mentioned above that a bishop is preferred to have obtained a PhD in  any of sacred Scripture, theology and canon law! Must the degree be obtained in Rome?
"Lately some candidates were rejected or accepted for being or not being a son of the soil in the diocese that has vacancy. Do the laity like in politics have a say in the appointment of a bishop?
"Some individuals also think a priest has the quality of a bishop, a priest, a good friend of my family, I saw the quality of a bishop in him, I told him he just laughed, he was appointed a  vicar general, I told him that is not what we wanted of him!  I did congratulate him on been made a Monsignor but I told him what I wish him to be, today he is a bishop!"

The questions from this are:

1,  Must a Bishop have a Doctorate Degree in any Sacred Scriptures, Theology, or Canon Law?
2.  Must a Bishop study in Rome?
3. Must a Bishop come from a Diocese which is vacant?
4. Does the Lay Faithful has a say in the appointment of a Bishop?
5.  Can an appointed Bishop be rejected?
6. Can one aspire to be a Bishop?

Be Blessed

Must a Bishop have a Doctorate Degree in any Sacred Scriptures, Theology, or Canon Law?

The 1983 Code of Canon Law states in Can. 378 §1. "In regard to the suitability of a candidate for the episcopacy, it is required that he is:

1/  Outstanding in solid faith, good morals, piety, zeal for souls, wisdom, prudence, and human virtues, and endowed with other qualities which make him suitable to fulfill the office in question;

2/ of good reputation;

3/ at least thirty-Five years old;

4/ ordained to the presbyterate for at least Five years;

5/ in possession of a doctorate or at least a licentiate in sacred scripture, theology, or canon law from an institute of higher studies approved by the Apostolic See, or at least truly expert in the same disciplines."

Every priest, before ordination, must have undergone some studies in Sacred Scriptures, Theology, and Canon Law which may or may not be at a Degree level depending on the Seminary or House of Formation. Priests may then  further their studies in these fields or other disciplines after ordination as the opportunities arise. The truth is that:
- There are priests who before being ordained bishops were experts in other areas of studies. 
- Not all Bishops studied in Rome
- Not all Bishops have Doctorate Degree before Episcopal Ordination, 

Why then are Bishops addressed as "The Right Reverend Dr. (Full Name)" or "The Most Reverend Dr. (Full Name)" or "the Most Reverend (Full Name), D.D"?

All Catholic bishops automatically receive the DD (Doctor of Divinity) degree upon their consecration because of their function as teachers of the faith. Apart from the assumed Doctor of Divinity, many Bishops have other Doctorate Degrees such as J.C.D or S.T.D., or Ph.D.

Must a Bishop come from a Diocese which is vacant?

(1) Free Wifi Google station in partnership with 21st century: Google Station provides high quality, high-speed Wi-Fi hotspots in Nigeria. The Wi-Fi hotspots are currently available at the Landmark Centre, The Palms Mall, Ikeja Mall, MMA2 Domestic Airport Terminal and with plans to launch in 200 locations in 5 cities across Nigeria by the end of 2019.
I will be ad-funded as phone numbers are collected for verification.I tried it yesterday and it was indeed fast.

(2) Google Go lightweight browser for low-end devices with read-along add-on:
This is targeted at users with low bandwidth and low-RAM devices.
The Go browser can read web pages out loud and highlight each word so users can follow along.

(3) Simplified health-related search for Nigerian-centric symptoms : Gogle worked with the University of Ibadan to optimize a local search function that allows users explore health conditions based on symptoms. 

(4) Google Street-view now expanded to 8 more states in Nigeria with tourist destinations included.

(5) Other product enhancement and new releases include the new version of YouTube Go where users will be able to browse downloaded YouTube Go videos, saved as .yt files, right from the gallery on their phones, Google Maps Go and Android Go (low weight for low end devices).

The Vice President, Prof Yemi Oshinbajo was in attendance. It had top business leaders across major verticals, partners and the tech ecosystem in attendance.

29/07/2018, 15:29 - figo: WHO IS A BISHOP? 4

While one can aspire to be a priest in the Catholic Church, and if called, truly be ordained priest, one cannot aspire to be a bishop.  What every catholic priest aspires to be is a priest and nothing more.  Although, Bishopric is a promotion in/of the Holy Orders, it is not a position that is acquired based on a right, the length of years in the ministry, influence/affluence or education. Notwithstanding, there are some priests that the lay faithful and even non-Catholics look up to as someone who may be a bishop.  Some people even pray day and night that a certain priest be ordained a bishop.  Although, it is not impossible that such person truly become a bishop of his diocese or another diocese, such prayer is only favorable where there is a vacancy.  If there is no vacant seat or the need for a succeeding bishop (co-adjutor), or an “associate/assisting” bishop (auxiliary), such prayer may remain only a wish or a desire that may never be fulfilled. Remember, “And no one can become a high priest simply because he wants such an honor. He must be called by God for this work, just as Aaron was” (Heb 5:4).

Must a Bishop come from a Diocese which is vacant?

The Catholic Church is universal hence, any priest from the vacant diocese as well as any other diocese can be appointed the bishop of a diocese or as auxiliary bishop. However, for pastoral reason, a priest of/from the vacant diocese may be more suitable for the diocese to reflect Hebrews 5:1, “Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins” (cf. Ex. 28:1; Heb 2:17). But there seem to be no law that says a priest, or a bishop must come from the community.

Does the Lay Faithful has a say in the appointment of a Bishop?
29/07/2018, 15:30 - figo: The lay Faithful does has a say in the appointment of a bishop for the voice of the people is the voice of God.  In the history of the Church, some bishops are appointed by popular acclamation.  The first centuries Church elected bishops by popular acclamation of the laity and the clergy, and local bishops ratified his election by participation in his consecration or at least by having his name inscribed on their diptychs. The Pope’s involvement was minimal and passive. Although, today, the ultimate decision in appointing bishops rests with the pope, and he is free to select anyone he chooses, the laity are informally involved through the way they reverence or talk about their priests and officially by participating at the local level in the enquiry and consultations concerning the suitability of the nominated candidates for bishopric until it reaches Rome. It is a process bound by strict confidentiality.

Can an appointed Bishop be rejected?

Be Blessed.

Let's draw a lesson from this story.... 


Men of gold don't wear gold. 

Yesterday I had to visit somewhere and it was raining so I did not want to drive there since I was not too familiar with the road, so I parked my car somewhere close and used a keke (local tricycle).

While I was there I got a call from a long time friend reminding me of my promise to her husband over a job, so I quickly told her my location, and asked her to tell her husband to meet me up ASAP since I will be leaving town soon, but I told her to tell her husband to meet me up where I packed my car since that place was a popular land mark .

I don’t know her husband and we have never met before. As I sent her the address, she called me back and was so excited that I was even around her area which will make it easy for him because he did not even have transport to come out,things was that bad. So I told her that he should pick a drop and I will pay.

In other not to keep him stranded I had to start rushing back to where I packed my car. God, I even entered under the rain, cold, just to meet up with him so he will not be stranded. As I was walking under the rain I saw a keke and stopped it. The keke man asked me to beg the man inside, so I started begging. The man refused and said I was wet. I told him I will sit one side, and he refused, saying except I pay for both his fare and mine.

I agreed, then he allowed me. As I entered this man kept me uncomfortable, saying if my wet clothes touch him again I will get down. I just kept my cool until I finally got to my destination. I did not even reach until I stopped at the junction and paid then used my legs to walk to my car, since it was very close.

I was inside my car warming myself, then I got a call from my friend saying her husband was around, so I described my car and he came. I saw someone knocked on my car glass, wound down and it was this same man in a keke with me. Gosh!

I was suppose to pay the keke man, and recommend him for a job? Tears rolled down my eyes, I brought out N3,000, gave him, started my car and zoomed off. My friend has been calling and sending me messages, I had to block her. Be careful, many times men of gold don’t wear gold . Be nice.

30/07/2018, 14:32 - figo: WHO IS A BISHOP? 5

Can an appointed Bishop be rejected?

It is not unheard of that a prophet or a priest or a bishop is rejected by the people of God. In fact, the Old Testament shows some prophets who were rejected by the people (cf. Hosea 9:7) that Jesus Christ expressed in Luke 4:24 that “No prophet is accepted in his hometown”.  Jesus Christ himself “came to his own, and his own people did not receive him” (Jn 1:11), and “was despised and rejected by men” (Is. 53:3).  Some Popes were rejected and exiled, and some bishops were rejected by the people they were to govern. 

Although, with the way the Catholic Church is structured, it is uncommon to have the diocese reject their given bishop, there have been stories of rejected bishops which either were later accepted or transferred or resign.  

Why would a diocese reject the appointed bishop?

The most common reason is the “son of the soil” syndrome.  Although, to have a bishop taken from among the people to be pastured and served seems to be scripturally and pastorally plausible, it becomes unchristian and uncatholic if a bishop is rejected because he is not from the same diocese.  Unchristian because we are all brothers and sisters in Christ, uncatholic because it questions the universality (unity and inclusiveness) of the Church.  

Another reason is when the appointed bishop is considered imposed on the community especially when some priests, religious and the laity consider the appointed bishop as not fit for pastoral and moral reasons.

Politicking is another reason for a bishop to be rejected.  This happens where there is an existing division among the clergies of the diocese about who is fit to assume the office of the bishop. This can become so dirty and unexpected of Christians.  However, considering human beings as homo politicus (political animal), it may not be unexpected in some circumstances even though not appropriate in any Christian setting.
30/07/2018, 14:34 - figo: But the truth is, rejection of Pope’s appointed person is a form of insubordination or disobedience to God and to Christ the Lord who says, “"Anyone who receives you receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the Father who sent me.” (Matt 10:40; cf. Lk 10:16; Jn. 13:20).  Obedience is a great virtue in Christian living. Yet, obedience is sometimes very difficult to the extent that it may bring suffering.  Suffering in Christ is, however, redemptive and reflects solid faith when approached as such.  This does not mean that the magisterium of the Church cannot make mistakes (for the Church is both Divine and Human), yet the mistakes are not corrected in disobedience, instead, disobedience of a part of the church can lead to schism (cf. Matt 12:25).  The things pertaining to God should not be handled with worldly ways of politicking.

“We continually thank God that in receiving the word of God from us, you did not accept it as the word of men, but as the true word of God--the word now at work in you who believe.” (1Thes 2:13)

Someone asked,  “…Why is it that when a Bishop … goes to another Archdiocese he cannot face his staff towards the congregation?...”

Be Blessed.

31/07/2018, 19:50 - figo: WHO IS A BISHOP? 6

Someone asked, “…Why is it that when a Bishop … goes to another Archdiocese he cannot face his staff towards the congregation?”

A Crozier or Crosier is a hooked staff carried by a bishop as a symbol of pastoral office or a staff resembling a shepherd's crook carried by bishops and abbots as a symbol of office.  It is an ecclesiastical ornament which is conferred on bishops at their consecration and investiture together with mitre and ring, and which is used by these bishops in performing certain solemn functions.  
The crosier is symbol of authority to correct vices, stimulate piety, administer punishment, and thus rule and govern with a gentleness that is tempered with severity. disciplinary power of bishops in virtue of which they may sustain the weak and faltering, confirm the wavering in faith, and lead back the erring ones into the true fold. 

It is also a symbol of jurisdiction. Hence, the crosier is to bishops what the scepter is to kings. For this reason, the bishop always carries his crosier with the crook turned outwards towards the congregation while presiding over the liturgy in his diocese. A sign that he is the Chief Shepherd of that diocese. However, if presiding over the liturgy in another diocese, he holds it with the head reversed. According to the liturgical book Ceremonial of Bishops (Liturgical Press, 1989, ISBN 081461819): 59, “The bishop carries the pastoral staff in his own territory as a sign of his pastoral office, but any bishop who, with the consent of the diocesan bishop, solemnly celebrates may use the pastoral staff.

01/08/2018, 09:13 - ‪+234 806 972 8498‬: TODAY 1ST AUGUST 
TOPIC:
SEX IN RELATIONSHIP
01/08/2018, 09:14 - ‪+234 806 972 8498‬: SEX IS NEVER ENOUGH....................

It's possible for any man to ask for sex in a relationship, but is left for you as a lady to know that sex, can't keep him..(Sex isn't enough)
There are two major factors ladies complain about sex in a relationship:
1. After giving him my body he left me..
2. He left because I refused to have sex with him..
NOTE: Both those who gave and those who refused to give are complaining...
( Whats the difference)
Ladies Listen, Sex isn't enough, its not the only thing you can offer a man.
If You Don't Have Anything To Offer A Man Outside Sex, Please remain Single...
A man can't stay with you because his having sex with you....
Relationship is not buying and selling.
There are much to life than Monkey style, Doggy style, Missionary style, Apple and juice style, step pillows style, etc ...
Are you sound intellectually? Spiritually? Physically? Mentally? Emotionally?
Men love intelligent ladies...
Men love ladies with ideas..
Men love respectful ladies...
Sex is very cheap these days, anybody can buy it.
You need to build yourself beyond sex.
Leave make-ups and be a productive lady.
Men are looking for ladies with ideas and solution not those who paint their faces with different colours.
What a man wants is beauty with brain not make ups with boobs or hips....
Sex is not everything about life there is more to life than sex .. 
So please build yourself very well , so that when the man is now coming to you your ability to arouse his loins and his intellect is what will keep you with the man outside that sex is sold on the street and he can always buy it .. Is cheaper everyday and he can afford it.
01/08/2018, 09:21 - ‪+234 806 972 8498‬: Now my advice to men is this:
Do not pressure a lady for sex, I know a fake man will demand for sex likewise a real man a fake man might  leave because he did not get it  but a real man that understands that sex doesn't worth it will stick around.
Let us all understand that sex before marriage is a sin before God.
Thank you and have a beautiful month ahead! Kudos!

02/08/2018, 08:24 - Tony Chukwu Cyaa: The Sexual Fast! So inspiring write up.

Daughter: (Coughs out) Hmmm…

Mum: (looks up at her, then continues picking her beans) Any gist for momma?

Daughter:( Looks at her) Mum, I think I am not normal anymore…like, I am sick

Mum: (Chuckles)  Sick?? Why?

Daughter: Because I am over-sensitive. Whenever I see a guy, I have this weird feeling compared to when I meet a girl. Mum, I get worried often times if I would scale through adolescence without defiling myself

Mum: (Laughs) you are afraid?

Daughter: It seems you don’t understand mum. When I see a guy’s bicep, oh my God! If he mistakenly exposes his abs, then I would almost faint, feeling as if I should run into his strong, muscular arms and be cuddled.

Mum: And so? That’s why you are not normal?

Daughter: (Eyes widen) Mum!

Mum: That shows that you are very normal my baby girl

Daughter: I don’t understand mum

Mum: You fasted recently right?

Daughter: Yes mum. A three-day dry fast

Mum: There was  an occasion that I made plantain and fried egg for dinner for the family. How did you feel that day?

Daughter: Mum, it was sensational! As if I had never tasted plantain . I wanted a bite so bad.

Mum: So, why didn’t you get into the kitchen to get yourself some?

Daughter: Mum, I was fasting

Mum: Nice one! Son, can you hear us from there? Put off the TV please.

Son: Ok mum.

Mum: As an adolescent boy or girl, don’t think it weird when you are attracted to the opposite sex. His or her stature or the like might appeal to you but it shows that you are  normal. You wouldn’t say, you are abnormal because you can perceive the aroma of fried plantain while you were fasting. Would you?

Both: No mum

Mum: All unmarried people in this world are on a sexual fast until they get married.  Different food like juices, fried fish, chicken; Shawarma and the likes would appeal to them clothed in handsome men and beautiful women of different shapes and sizes but you've got to block your perception! You are fasting!

Daughter: (nods repeatedly) Hmmm…I am getting it now

Mum: The aroma could be pornography, sexy boys and girls, devilish games and all but be warned, you are what?

Both: Fasting!

Mum: So my daughter, you are normal. It means all the parts of your body are responding well but the Bible says you should keep your body under control.

Daughter: Mum, I can’t thank you enough. I expected you to scream at me , frown your face but You are trustworthy and I can count on you. And that is why mum is our… (Signals to the boy)

Son: Confidant! (Both laugh)

Mum: (Smiles) Blessed children…very very blessed!

Both: most blessed mother

Mum: But never forget the lesson learnt today…(expects an answer)

Both: We are fasting!

Mum: Yes. The fast would soon be over and your dish of dodo, freshly prepared with well garnished fried egg with a chill bottle of wine would be delivered to you but first, wait! Say, I will wait

Both: I will wait!

Mum: And the Lord will bless you.

Both: Amen (They hug their mother and she blesses them both)

Keep Sharing until it gets to every eye and the Lord will bless you real good.

Let's be such a parent to our blessed children.

02/08/2018, 12:55 - figo: KNOWING I AM IN LOVE AND I AM LOVED I

Someone asked: 
“How do I know that I am in love with someone?”  
“How do I know that someone truly loves me?”  
“How do I know the plan of God for me concerning the person?”

It may be easy to feel that one is in love with another person;
But it may be difficult to know what it really is: love, infatuations or lust
It may be easy to believe the other person’s proof of love through care, concern, company, and lavished generosity
But it may be difficult to know if these nice gestures are from the heart or just traps
Hence you are in love today, but in hate tomorrow
The other person claims to love you today, but abandons you tomorrow

Think about the questions below in both directions -

Are you patient with him/her? 
Do you consider yourself kind?
Are you passionately jealous that you can kill?
Do you boast over being better or righteous or holy?
What are you proud about?
Are you often disrespectful of the person?
Do you pay more attention to yourself and your feelings than the other person?
How quick do you get angry about what he/she does or says?
Do you judge and relate with him/her based on your past experiences?
Have you ever hurt him/her directly or indirectly – in words or in acts?
Do you protect his/her integrity or from insults?
Do you trust him/her with others and with your life?
Are you ready to bear with the setbacks hoping on the better future?
Are you ready to hold on in suffering, in sickness and in poverty?
Can you die for the person?

For “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres” (1Cor 13:4-7).
02/08/2018, 12:57 - figo: It is easier to discover your love for someone than for you to be sure of someone’s love for you. And remember that “loving someone is not a guarantee that the person will love you back”– for you rarely find a reciprocated love, where there is, they may not marry, and where they are married, they may not last.  Because in most cases, one loves and the other likes, and the one who likes takes the advantage of the one who loves.

Yet, Love is a Fruit of the Spirit (cf Gal 5:22; Rom 5:5), and only when you are in the Spirit will you know the value of True Love and be able to see through who is in love with you.

What about knowing God’s plan concerning the person you love and whom you think loves you?

"Pour out your unfailing love on those who love you; give justice to those with honest hearts.” (Ps 36:10)

“For I know the plans I have for you," says the LORD. "They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope" (Jer. 29:11)

02/08/2018, 13:35 - figo: KNOWING THE PLAN OF GOD IN A RELATIONSHIP
	
In a situation where one cannot distinguish between true love, infatuation and lust; between authentic gesture of love and traps to take one down, it is only appropriate and reasonable to go back to the Author of life who knows man through and through and in and out.  No wonder names and pictures of lover boys and girls are flying around from one man of God to the other; and sometimes in the hands of diviners, voodoo psychics and spiritualists, all in the name of knowing the will and plan of God concerning certain relationships – trying to know the right person; eliminating the possibility of making mistakes.

People have prayed and fasted and have dreamt dreams.  Men of God and spiritualists have seen visions and signs have been sought.  The revealed right person have disappointed, duped, and have disappeared abandoning the relationship.  Is it the case that the men of God didn’t see any vision or they just told you what you wanted to hear or the dreams weren’t real or that one is not listening to the voice of God or not ready to do as the Lord instructed?  Think of the scriptural passages below:

-	The LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." (1Sam 16:7)

-	“Divination, omens, and dreams are unreal; what you already expect, the mind fantasizes. Unless they are specially sent by the Most High, do not fix your heart on them. For dreams have led many astray, and those who put their hope in them have perished.” (Sirach 34:5-7)

-	You may be asking why I changed my plan. Do you think I make my plans carelessly? Do you think I am like people of the world who say "Yes" when they really mean "No"? (2Cor 1:17)
02/08/2018, 13:36 - figo: How do you know the will or the plan of God in this complexity?  The truth is, God speaks to us in many various ways (cf Heb 1:1).  In many times we want it in easy ways and we expect it to favor us or please our spirit or desire.  But God ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts (cf Is 55:8).  The truth is, if God chooses for you, are you ready to accept the person of His choice?  If God says you should marry that hardened criminal, will you accept that as the will of God for you?  Or if your God says you should marry someone who has married 6 times and have had all the husbands/wives died the night of the wedding (cf. Tobit 3:8ff; Matt:22: 25-27), will you go ahead? Won’t you remind God saying, but You said that You know the plans You have for me, that they are plans for good and not for disaster, to give me a future and a hope? (cf. Jer. 29:11). 

Different individuals may have different ways of discovering the plan and will of God depending on the person’s faith and relationship with God.  It may also requires
1.	Absolute trust in God (cf. Prov. 3:5; Ps 62:8)
2.	Listen to God concerning the circumstances (cf. Acts 16:6-10)
3.	Walking in the Spirit (cf. Gal 5:16-25)
4.	Seeking Counsel (Cf. Prov. 11:14)
5.	Considering one’s personality (cf. Ps 139:14)
6.	If you are ready and he/she is not ready, Be Patient (cf. 1Cor 13:4)
7.	Follow your heart in God  (cf. Ps 37:4-5)
8.	Yet do not push anything, just let it be (cf. Lk. 22:42) 
9.	If you love and want him/her but he/she doesn’t want you – LET IT GO.

A *mindset towards a life partner* is our major problem. *Is always the will or plan of God for a Union of man and woman*  nothing like complexity. May God help us

MY PROBLEM WITH THE DEGREE. MY ENCOUNTER WITH GRADUATES/UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. 

By Henry Mutebe

Yesterday, a friend called to check on me. It had been long since we talked. He asked if I had sometime so I could roll over and check on him. I was happy to go check on him. After we had finished University, he had started a small restaurant in town. It has grown exponentially over the years. When I arrived at the restaurant, I was very impressed by how many leaps he had made, in what I believe to be a short time for a business like his. We shuffled through the memories and had a hearty laugh. 

As hours went by, I noticed that when customers entered and took seats, he was attending to them and doing a lot of the serving. I asked him if he didn’t have enough staff. He told me that one of the girls working at the restaurant was sick while another guy simply didn’t show up or call to let him know…so he was short of labour. I asked if I can help. He joked, ‘Henry you know I can’t afford you. Here I pay 10,000shs to the attendants. How will I manage to pay you?'  I told him am happy to work. 

I quickly oriented myself on the etiquette and customer care rules …and most importantly what was available. So we started serving people that came in. In total, I served about 8 clients before something interesting happened. 

As we talked and laughed about the crazy things we did in school, two students I taught at University (a gentleman and lady) came by. They did not immediately notice I was the one but their eyes kept preying on me to confirm they were seeing the ‘real person.’

To confirm their disbelief, I asked my friend to let me serve them. So I went over, humbled myself, bent slightly, greeted them and asked to take their orders. They were very surprised and asked me, ‘What are you doing here sir?’ I told them that am there to serve them.  They looked at each other and with the face of mixed feelings wondered why I would be working in a restaurant. 

The girl asked, ‘Sir, but why are you working here? You can’t serve us. I mean…?’ she nodded her head in disbelief before continuing, ‘…you can’t work in a restaurant?’. I told them I would serve them and am happy to take their orders. You could easily notice that they were very surprised and reserved about placing their orders. 

They had mixed feelings about my presence there and the type of work I was doing.  After a very interesting exchange, they finally made their order which I delivered promptly. They had their delicious meal as we also continued conversing and reminiscing the years gone by. From time to time, I kept checking on them and asked if they needed anything else. When they were done, my friend punched in the bill, printed the receipt and I delivered it to them. 

Their bill was 24,500shs. I placed it on the table and took the plates away. The guy placed two notes (a 20k and 10k shs) on the table and they left. I delivered it to my friend, who was now serving as manager, cashier and sometimes a waiter. He gave me back the change of 5,500shs which I happily slipped into my wallet.  By the way ...by this time, I had 15,000shs in tips from the other 8 clients I had served. So by adding this 5500shs, I was 20,500shs rich already.
 
As the couple (my former students) went out, they each looked back in disbelief. I looked at them and raised my hand to say bye. They walked into the street and faded away into the bright light from approaching cars. A couple of other clients came in and I served them. My friend was very pleased and paid my 10000shs and a bonus of 2000shs which he says he offers once a waiter exceeds a certain number of clients.  At 11pm, I left the restaurant and went home. 

As I sat in the car to head back home, I couldn’t help thinking about my students. Their disbelief was innocent…but it speaks a lot about a general problem we have in our society. These two students represent thousands of others. They me made think, very deeply, about our Ugandan graduates. I do not blame them, its a general problem.

 I have had the opportunity to travel and study from elsewhere or in other cultures and I have always been surprised by how people in other countries don’t despise jobs. My good students could not imagine their lecturer serving them in a restaurant. Since they know my work and qualifications, they could not understand how I can be in a restaurant at this time. As if it takes away my degree or other job. It gave me a lot of thoughts about our graduates. The more I have travelled, the more I have learned and unlearned. 

In 2012, while at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England, one of my classmates used to drive a BMW, park it at a restaurant and work as a waiter. He came from a very wealthy family but he still worked. He told me that as soon as he completed high school, he had to take part time jobs to earn some money to pay rent to his father and contribute to household bills. It shocked me quite a lot considering what I have grown up seeing in my part of the world. 

As if this was not enough, I also found out that, when students finish high school in these countries, as must, they have to find some work and either rent out, or pay their parents some money for rent if they are to continue staying in their parent’s house.  I was shocked by the idea of a son paying rent to his father. It took time to sink in. The more I interacted with more of these people, the more I realised that this is a common culture. They teach a child responsibility from a very early age. Work is not for money per se, it is a service.

The lesson I learnt from them is that working is a value. One has to work and parents teach their children that they have to work and earn. Just because your parents are wealthy doesn’t mean your life is already worked out. You have to contribute to the home bills and somehow find something to do. The work doesn’t have to be white colour…but as a must, you have to find something to put your hands to. You cant seat your bums and just wait for a white collar job.

When I went to Norway, I found the same story. Most university students, unless they simply can’t find time due to course overload, have to have some form of temporary work. Students often work as attendants, waiters in restaurants, cleaners in hotels, shop attendants, drivers, newspaper vendors, et cetera. It is a value to work and few people dont despise jobs. 

By the way, they don’t work because their parents can’t give them money. They work because it is a value that has been embedded in them from childhood. Once a student finishes high school, they take on a part time job and save money for use at university or travels. Few parents will buy their child a ticket to come to Africa to tour. You have to work and save for your luxuries.  

If you want some money from your parents, you borrow and pay back. Nothing comes free. They teach you to live on your own. Being at University or having a degree is ‘nothing.’ You are not the first or the last. Serving people in a restaurant does not make anyone look less a graduate. Service is service! Work is a value. 

As a matter of fact, most of the places near Universities are filled with university students working as part timers. University students are encouraged to take up these part time jobs. The white people we like to imitate are doing what we think is too dirty or casual for a graduate in Africa. 

It got me thinking about students in our Universities here in Uganda. I thought about all the restaurants around Wandegeya, Banda –Kyambogo, MUBS, and the attitude of University students and graduates about these type of jobs. I thought about the poor attitude we have towards work. I looked at the chapatti boys and girls we despise who are minting money and doing great things in their lives and for their families. I thought about the people who fear nothing, who go out and just do it while we sit back.

The more I thought about it the more I realised why we are going to take longer to develop. We have a generation of young people who feel they are too educated to do certain jobs. We have a generation of children who have been prepared for a life that doesn’t exist. We have a crop of young people who are whiter than the whites. My time in Europe taught me that we need to get back on the drawing board and re-orient our graduates. 

Students in our universities should be oriented to appreciate the value of work. There is no reason why a University should not employ students to clean the Library, kitchen, dining halls, hostels. It is improper that a university canteen should find external staff when it has over 30,000 students who can work in shifts and serve other students. 

See, through this kind of work, being able to do ordinary jobs and be seen as a servant makes you true leaders. When students grow up with a sense of entitlement and a higher standard of living, it translates into greed when they get into national politics. They apportion themselves good things, higher privileges and want to float above everyone because work is about money, status and not service. Such humble work makes true leaders. 

People who are willing to serve, and not merely earn make better leaders. Such work raises a generation of leaders who don’t do things to be seen or be thought of as higher and more qualified, but leaders who get things done. In some firms in western societies, when they look at a CV, such experience, demonstrates the attitude of a person, their humility, values and philosophy towards work.  

We are raising a generation of children whose only image of the west is what they watch on TV. They speak using enhanced accents, know what is the latest, they are ‘cool’ but they have no idea what makes the west what it is. My experience in the west shows me something different. People work and do ordinary jobs and that’s how things get done. 

If we are to get good leaders, we must first change the attitude of young people about work. An inflated self-image creates bad leaders who want to further segregate themselves from the ordinary people they consider low and less qualified. We have a big problem in our society and we have to find a way to deal with it. 

Students despise these jobs because they believe work is about status and money. Taken further into their lives, it means they may likely want to maintain status and money as their pursuits when they get into leadership positions. If we must correct our leadership and governance problems, we may also need to do something about the attitude of students and graduates about their philosophies and values about work. In there, lies a very big problem. 

Do not despise work, go out there and just work. The pope was once a bouncer at a club. Today he is one of the most powerful men in the world. Imagine that you had nothing to fear, what would you do to earn a living? Imagine that you had no degree or that anyone cares, what would you do to earn a living? Imagine, that no one is going to help you find a job, what would do? 

I am not saying go do what you dont like...but may be...just may be you may need to develop a new attitude towards work, serve people (in whatever opportunities unfold) and be happy to have served. You can never tell what the future holds, and you may never know who you will meet at your humble place of work. Most interestingly, you may never know the untold story of those who work and serve you in those places where you go as the bosses or the rich. 

Even for you that are already employed in 'high' places, don’t mind going out and just find a part time job (if you have time) or offer services in the evening or weekend at any place where your services can be of use. Meet people, network and just keep yourself active. Degrees are everywhere...literally every one has them...so just forget about the whole hype about it and be true to yourself. As you look for other opportunities...dont be afraid to branch off a little and keep yourself at something. Don’t despise jobs. Serve. I am now looking for my next gig. I am happy to serve. So you restaurant/hotel people...dont fear to holla at me...If I have time...I will come and serve with a smile...😁

Cheers.

😃😃😃😃😃

Lawyers should never ask grandmas a question if they aren’t prepared for the answer!

In a trial, a small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, an elderly grandmother to the stand.

He approached her and asked; _"Mrs. Jones, do you know me?"_

She responded, _"Why, yes, I do know you, Mr. Williams._ _I've known you since you were a young boy, and frankly, you're a  big disappointment to me.._
_You lie, cheat on your wife, manipulate  people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a  big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will  amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know  you.."_

The lawyer was stunned!  Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked,  _"Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney (the opponent's lawyer)?"_

She again replied, _"Why, yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster. He's lazy, bigoted, and has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone  and his law practice is one of the worst in the state. Not to  mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of  them was your wife. ..Yes I know him."_   

The defense attorney almost *died*.

The judge asked both lawyers to approach the bench and in a quiet  voice said: 

_*"If either of you rascals asks her if she knows me,  I'll send you to jail for contempt of court !*

To All
Catholic Bishops and Major Superiors of Institutes of Consecrated Life,
Catholic Priests, Consecrated men and women,
Catholic Lay Faithful,
We, the members of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), as teachers of the faith and morals do have the serious obligation to educate our faithful on their role in the political life of the country. 
We have observed that the political atmosphere is very tense and also noticed the political realignment that is taking place. Some politicians are changing political parties and urging their supporters to switch over their support to their new parties as well. Given this development, we wish to use this opportunity to make it clear that the Catholic Church remains ever apolitical and does not endorse or subscribe to any political party.
Consequently, we hereby declare that no Catholic clergy or religious should publicly endorse any candidate for political office. Liturgical ceremonies must never be used as an opportunity for political campaigns. Similarly, ecclesiastical properties should not be used as places for support for any political candidate or party. All priests and religious should avoid giving the impression that the Church favours one candidate over another or one political party over another.

These are difficult times in the history of Nigeria. As people of faith we must work hard and also pray hard for the future of Nigeria. During the military rule, the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) composed the Prayer for Nigeria in Distress. Dearly beloved in Christ, Nigeria is in distress. We consequently, call on Catholics to recite this prayer at all Masses and other liturgical celebrations. We entrust Nigeria into the hands of God and implore Him to improve the situation in our country. May God intervene in the life of Nigeria once again, so that we can enjoy true peace, justice, and prosperity. 

May God bless Nigeria.

08/08/2018, 10:01 - figo: WHO IS A PRIEST?

He is just one of us,
Called and Chosen from a rich or a poor family.
He is like us in all things and sin;
His ordination empowers him,
His ordination does not change him;
Yet his ordination sets him apart.

Although a sinner, he is able to bring God down on the Altar of Sacrifice,
And able to offer sacrifices for his own sin and the sins of others;
He is a mediator between God and man.

He may be so young,
Yet, he is the spiritual father of his father and grandfathers;
The spiritual eldest of his elders.
He can influence and be influenced.
His wealth and poverty are his flock.

He may be childish, yet revered as an elder;
He may be ignorant, yet approached for wisdom;
He can be wrong, and he can be corrected.

He is just as human as anyone else,
Yet closer to the divine in his weaknesses and strengths.
He prays for all and sundry,
He needs the prayers of all.

Be Blessed.
08/08/2018, 10:06 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: Nice explanation
08/08/2018, 10:08 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: Priest. [N] [E]
The English word is derived from the Greek presbyter , signifying an "elder" (Heb. cohen ). Origin. --The idea of a priesthood connects itself in all its forms, pure or corrupted, with the consciousness, more or less distinct of sin. Men feel that they have broken a law. The power above them is holier than they are, and they dare not approach it. They crave for the intervention of some one of whom they can think as likely to be more acceptable than themselves. He must offer up their prayers, thanksgivings, sacrifices. He becomes their representative in "things pertaining unto God." He may become also (though this does not always follow) the representative of God to man. The functions of the priest and prophet may exist in the same person. No trace of a hereditary or caste priesthood meets us in the worship of the patriarchal age. Once and once only does the word cohen meet us as belonging to a ritual earlier than the time of Abraham. Melchizedek is "the priest of the most high God." ( Genesis 14:18 ) In the worship of the patriarchs themselves, the chief of the family, as such, acted as the priest. The office descended with the birthright, and might apparently he transferred with it. When established. --The priesthood was first established in the family of Aaron, and all the sons of Aaron were priests. They stood between the high priest on the one hand and the Levites on the other. [HIGH PRIEST; LEVITES] The ceremony of their consecration is described in HIGH GOD. (Genesis 14,18)

09/08/2018, 14:30 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: I chose this topic cos it's a virtue I truly cherish. It is also an inportant virtue because most youth especially youths of nowadays are yet to build this virtue. What is the meaning? Patience is the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, problems, or suffering without becoming anoyed or anxious.
09/08/2018, 14:31 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: In all spheres of our life patience is necessary. We need patience when dealing with our fellow brethren and even unbelievers
09/08/2018, 14:33 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: We often find that we disagree with others' way of thinking, actions or behaviour cos we are all different and have different mindsets from different backgrounds. Even no identical twins are d same in character
09/08/2018, 14:34 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: Consequently, we find that we detest the other person's behaviour; failing to know where he or she is coming from or what he has passed through in life to be the way he is
09/08/2018, 14:35 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: We find ourselves bickering, fighting, losing our tempers with d person, without being patient enough
09/08/2018, 14:37 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: The bible says in Eph. 4:2 that we should always be humble, gentle and patient. Show your love by being tolerant with one another.
09/08/2018, 14:37 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: Also in speech we should be patient as hot temper causes argument but patience brings peace

09/08/2018, 14:38 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: In d sphere of even learning and making money we have to be patient
09/08/2018, 14:39 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: Sometimes impatience can us to be easily irritated to learn new skills
09/08/2018, 14:39 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: U feel ... oh! How can learn this new skill, it will take me so and so years to learn this skill, look at my mates see which level they are now
09/08/2018, 14:42 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: The I want to get rich attitude by all means nowadays is killing this important virtue as many youths are not patient to harness their God given talent to make money. They can do  anything evil and criminal cos of lack of patience
09/08/2018, 14:43 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: Also, patience is connected to long suffering and or forbearance. When we are in a difficulty it is so easy to drop d the towel and give up
09/08/2018, 14:44 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: Tired of d tribulations of this world

09/08/2018, 14:50 - ‪+234 803 800 9782‬: As we meditate upon this message for today may this virtue of patience be built so as to withstand any difficulty we are passing through IJN, Amen

HOW TO LOWER YOUR PHCN BILL...,...

A thread on why PREPAID METER being distributed TO ALL may never be achieved in Nigeria.
After the Nigerian Police, Nigerian Electricity distribution companies are next on the list when it comes to corruption. This has been in existence from time immemorial, just like barracks, many government have come and gone but the deep rooted corruption in the system remains
In April 2016, I moved in to my current apartment. The apartment was still connected to an old meter and there was an outstanding payment of about N385,000.00 to be paid. 

This wasn't revealed to me before I made payment for the rent, as usual (that's how they all do)
This became a worry and an absolute headache. 

I asked the landlord why it was so and she made me understand that the apartment was not in use for 5years.

I asked how come it wasn't reported to NEPA so they'd stop the billing, she gave me a copy of the letter she wrote to them
So I took the matter up, wrote several mails to Eko electricity company and the matter was on for 11months, note that in the space of this 11 months, I never got a monthly bill lesser than 24,000.00

You want to ask if I have a factory in my apartment? No I don't.
So it extended from wanting the company to zerorize the ridiculous outstanding balance in the billing account to fighting and contesting the outrageous billing system which do not in any way represent my true electricity consumption and wanting a Prepaid Meter

The battle began.
After several exchange of mails betweens myself and Eko Electric and no solution was forthcoming, I moved the matter to NERC, the regulatory body for all electricity distribution companies in Nigeria. 

I filed a petition against Ekedp and the undertaking in charge of my area.
Lo and behold, after three days from the petition submission to NERC, I got a call from the marketing manager for my area pleading for me to make myself available to allow them come to my house and take inventory of the electrical appliances I use. 

NERC is working yeah? Right.
A staff of the Ekedp came to take the inventory and at the end of the computations, we calculated and multiplied each appliance by the estimated units they consume per day and multiplied by 31days. 

Recall I said I never got a bill less than 24k in a month?
Then we arrived at a figure that even the Eko electric staff who came to take the inventory opened his mouth and couldn't close it. 

What I should be billed based on having 24hour light per day(which is not even possible) in 31 days was 4,800.00

I almost ran mad.
I took a copy of the report, scanned it and attached it to my next petition to NERC. 

At this point, the marketing manager attached to my undertaking had started calling and begging me to stop the petitions. 

That they could all get sacked if matters gets escalated further.
Then in September 2017, after all the troubles and how I never got tired if pursuing the issue, I got a mail from Eko electricity to come with some required documents in order to fill a form for a PREPAID METER. 

I went there and did as they requested

At Last.
On 27 November 2017, I was on leave.
I was at my gate then this Alfa looking guy was parading and trying to see house number on the fence. My instinct told me to ask if he was asking for Ayo, then he said yes

He was the prepaid meter installer, he was with my new prepaid meter
I also recall that before the whole issue started, I was discouraged severally that I can never be given prepaid meter due to the outstanding balance on the billing account, I paid no mind to all the people that said that and went ahead with my case.
I got the Prepaid meter for FREE. After a week, bill was brought and boom, outstanding balance has been cleared from 385,000.00 to zero balance. 

How did I achieve this? 
I mean I didn't pay a dime to anyone and I never for once bribed my way in all my dealings.
I achieved this simply because;

1. I knew my right.
2. I wouldn't settle for mediocrity
3. I never stopped pushing even after several months and it seemed unachievable
4. I was ready to take the matter up anywhere
5. I was informed.
Now imagine how many people are out there who don't even know how to go about such tedious and draining process. 

I learnt that a lot of people even paid as much as 40k to get the prepaid meter. Something that's supposed to be free.
Since the prepaid meter was installed in November 27 2017, I have not exhausted the 303 units that came with it which is calculated to be 7,200.00

And I still have 140units left to use.

That's over four (4) months now
Do you now see why these people will never allow dream of every homes having a prepaid meter become a reality? 

Because such development will block all holes where the electricity distribution corrupt members of staff perpetrate their fraudulent activities and corruption from.
They know that they will be forced to give light more in order to generate revenue and will not be able to charge people outrageously as they are currently doing and remitting the proceeds of their criminal act to their pockets. 

Stand up and Fight for what is your right.
Prepaid meter is your right, fight for it to the letter. 

If you believe that your monthly electricity bill do not represent your consumption, make a case.

If you're in Lagos, Ikeja Electricity company and Eko electricity company are there for you. 

If they fail, involve NERC.
That will be all, for now.
Due to popular demand, these are the email addresses you can forward your complaints to -
Ikeja Electricity Distribution - customercare@ikejaelectric.com
Eko Electricity Distribution - customercare@ekedp.com
Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission - complaints@nerc.gov.ng

Do you know that, by law, you are entitled to at least 14 days between the date you receive your Electricity bill and the date when you are to pay that bill?

Do you know that, by law, your Electricity Distribution Company must give you a written notice of disconnection before it can disconnect you for non-payment of your bill?

If you answered yes to the last question, then do you know that, by law, your Electricity Distribution Company must wait for at least 90 days from the date of giving you notice of disconnection, before it can legally disconnect you?

Do you know that if you are unlawfully disconnected, you can compel your distribution company to reconnect you without paying reconnection fee, and that you can get this done without going to court?

Do you know that, if you are illegally disconnected, you are entitled to damages at a minimum of #1,000 per day to be paid by your Electricity Distribution Company for each day of disconnection till your power is restored?

Do you know that there is an administrative body that meets in your city, or a city close to you, that monitors the activities of Electricity Distribution Companies and will compel them to respect your rights if they breach same?

If you answered NO to any of these questions, then you, like so many others, are the victim of a conspiracy of silence by the Electricity distribution companies, who have been statutorily mandated to carry out regular public awareness campaigns on these and other consumer rights within their franchise area.

There is a solution at hand.

An online platform has been created to educate power consumers of their rights under the reformed power sector in Nigeria. Not only that, if you have suffered from any breach of your rights, you can get *free help* on that platform to enforce your rights.

Go to www.nepawahala.ng.

Register. Ask any question that bothers you. Ask for help. It's all free.

Go to www.nepawahala.ng.

One candle loses nothing by lighting another. It only spreads light and pushes back this present darkness.

If you have suffered from a breach of your rights as a power consumer, chances are someone you know has been, or is, a victim too.

Light a candle. Push back the darkness by forwarding this message to at least 20 persons.

14/08/2018, 14:30 - figo: THE WORD OR THE EUCHARIST


When you go to the Church, what are your expectations? What do you want to achieve? What exactly makes you feel that you have attended Church; The Word of God or the Eucharist? 

The Holy Eucharist (The Holy Communion; The Body and Blood of Christ) is the “summit” of and the “source,” of Christian life. It is what every Christ faithful desires because it is the “Perfect Union” with Christ the Lord. Coming to the Church without receiving the Holy Eucharist is like being invited to a feast without partaking in the banquet. The Banquet of the Lord is received with due spiritual preparation. Everyone ought to examine him/herself before partaking in the body and blood of the Lord (1 Cor 11:27-28). The Proclamation of the Word of God and the Homily help an individual faithful to personally make adequate preparation. They also help in the examination of conscience before one partakes in the Holy Eucharist; for the Word of God is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives (2 Tim 3:16). “The Church, therefore, earnestly desires that Christ's faithful, when present at this mystery of faith (Holy Mass), should not be there as strangers or silent spectators. On the contrary, through a good understanding of the rites and prayers they should take part in the sacred action, conscious of what they are doing, with devotion and full collaboration. They should be instructed by God's word, and be nourished at the table of the Lord's Body” (Vat II: The Constitution of the Sacred Liturgy, # 48). Therefore, hearing the Word is essential before receiving the Eucharist. 

Ask yourself: How often do I go late to Mass? Is it appropriate to receive the Eucharist without listening to the Word? Do I recognize the Lord Jesus Christ in the Eucharist or just fulfilling all righteousness? Am I keen at going home more blessed or just – as usual? Remember whoever hears God’s word … has eternal life (Jn. 5:25).
14/08/2018, 14:30 - figo: And unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves (Jn. 6:53).  Yet if you eat and drink the body and blood of Christ unworthily, you eat and drink damnation to yourself, not discerning the Lord's body (1Cor 11:29). Stay worthy and so partake. 

Be Blessed.

*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
3.... *Maturity* is when you learn to let go even if it pains.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*

*-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
6... *Maturity* is when you stop proving to the world how RIGHT OR SUPERIOR you are.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
7.... *Maturity* is when you stop comparing yourself with others because life is not a competition.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-*
8.... *Maturity* is when you understand that you can't and shouldn't always get what you want every time.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
9.... *Maturity* is when you are contented and satisfied with your life and yet aspiring to be better everyday..
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
10.... *Maturity* is when someone hurt you and you understand their attitude and stay clear, rather than trying to hurt them back.

*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
14.... *Maturity* is when you love more and judge less.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
15.... *Maturity* is responsibility
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
16.... *Maturity* is Love
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
17.... *Maturity* is the application of wisdom and knowledge in humility..
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
18... *Maturity* is when you accept that your accomplishment, failures, destiny, reputations and virtually everything about your life depends on God's will and the choices you make and not pointing fingers at others.
*+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+*
19... *Maturity* is when someone hates you and you still pray for them to succeed.

He pointed towards his laptop, asked me to take it and go outside, then come back and try to sell him the laptop.. he thought himself as actor Leonardo Di Caprio of "The wolf of wall street" movie..
So I took the laptop and left..

- left...!! Then what?
- nothing 30 minutes later he called me up... begging me to return his laptop to him coz all his work and important documents were in it..... so I asked him: *Will you buy it ??*                                  😜😁😆🤣

15/08/2018, 20:45 - ‪+234 806 972 8498‬: *THERE IS TOMORROW*

*Whenever you are dealing with people, you must always remember that there is tomorrow and you might néed them tomorrow. You may end up needing help from the people who are asking for your help today, so help as much as you can.*

*Life is like moving wheel, sometimes you are up and sometimes you are down. Sometimes we destroy the bridges that we might need to help us cross back tomorrow. Sometimes we treat people as though there is never going to be tomorrow. We sometimes act as though we will never need help from anyone. Remember there's tomorrow.*

*Joseph helped the cupbearer in prison and later the cupbearer connected Joseph with Pharaoh. Imagine how Portiphar's wife felt when she heard that Joseph was now the Governor of Egypt, after she had falsely accused him. The brother who sold Joseph away ended up being fed by him. Don't ever think of going to the extreme with your offenders, they might be rescuers tomorrow. Always remember that there is tomorrow and it will surely come.*

*The little help you give to people today, will profit you tomorrow.*
*May the good Lord touch your heart to live your life knowing that there is tomorrow.*

*In Everything You Do, Always Remember That,There Is Tomorrow.*

16/08/2018, 10:11 - Henry Osah: Grace is an ability for you to do what you have no power to do, and this is only given by God. You slept last night at the mercy of death but you are up this morning by His Grace. I pray for you this morning that the grace of God will always be with you all the days of your life and you will accomplish the Lord's desires for your life. Because you have been privileged by God to see the light of today, I pray that your eyes will not see evil, your ears will not hear evil, your feet will not enter the traps and evil nets of your adversaries. The evil arrows that fly in the day will not hit you and any member of your family. You will go out in peace and surely return in peace in Jesus name. Amen🙏.Good morning

17/08/2018, 08:26 - Ify Ikeogu: Very  motivational. 

Long  time  ago there  lived  a  great king  and  two beggars  who always  stood  at the  gate  of  his  palace  everyday.

As  the  king  rode by  everyday,  the 1st beggar would say 'blessed  is  he whom  the  king helps' while  the 2nd beggar would say 'blessed is he whom God helps'. 

The  king  always felt  pleased  to hear  the  praise  of the 1st  beggar.

One  evening  the king  decided  to reward  the  1st beggar  for  all  the praise;  he  ordered his  baker  to  bake a  cake  and  wrapped gold inside  the  cake.

The  next day  as  he  rode  by, he gave  the  cake  to the  1st beggar  as he  hailed  him  as usual. 

The 1st beggar  who  was  in  dire need  of  cash  sold  the  cake  to  the 2nd beggar at  a cheap  price. 

When the 2nd beggar cut open the cake he saw the gold, sold them and became a wealthy man. 

He did not return to the king's gate the next day.

As  the  king  rode out  of  his  palace the  next day,  he saw  the  1st beggar  still  begging for money  and stopped  to  ask him  if  he  ate  the cake  he  gave  him.

The  1st beggar replied  and  said  no  sir,  I  sold  it  to my  friend  who  was  here  with  me yesterday;  I  have not  seen  him today.

The  king shook his head, highly disappointed and confessed silently to himself that 

" Indeed Blessed is he Who God helps"  

Our  God  is  the  all knowing  God, HE has  not  forgotten you. God  always does His work just  in  time.

Be  blessed  and  Trust  God  even  when  you  don't understand  His WILL. Someday your blessings shall be in abundance. 

Remain Blessed!!! Kindly Share to Bless others...

18/08/2018, 06:16 - Ify Ikeogu: *Is it ever hard for you to pray? Can we be honest? Prayer can be exhausting*

Lord God, Hear My Prayers

At their most mediocre, prayers can momentarily pause your mind to remind you of the mind-Creator.

At worst, your prayers can seem futile and ineffective. Hollow words bouncing around an empty room.

The theme of this meditation from Romans 8 is prayers that are heard.  How the Holy Spirit himself intercedes for you when you are too exhausted to pray.  Or when your prayers sound like wordless groans.

 
Let me pray now that the Holy Spirit also helps you in your weaknesses.  God knows you struggle to find the words, so I pray you find peace knowing the Spirit Himself makes intercession for you with groanings which cannot be uttered.  Now may the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord show you His favor and give you His peace through Christ.  Amen.

 
In the days ahead you will surely face moments in prayer where you are unable to speak.  Pause then and consider, to rejoice. Fight against frustration and celebrate that the Holy Spirit is translating the silence into sweet aromatic prayers to God on your behalf.

 
Consider too how you can meet a friend to someone seeking words.  How might the Spirit be using you to pray on their behalf too? Shaping their words and thoughts to God for them.  What a beautiful gift you can give a friend. Give the world.

 
So when you are ready, whether at the sunrise or sunset of your day, remember what Martin Luther once said, “to be a Christian without prayer is no more possible than to be alive without breathing.”  So be satisfied with silent prayers of simply breathing without words, because it is then and there you encounter God

18/08/2018, 13:26 - figo: ASSUMPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY, IS IT IN THE BIBLE? I

Someone asked, “Habba! Mary was assumed into heaven?  Where is it in the Bible?” Part 1

Today, the Christian Bible is very accessible to everyone, Christians and non-Christians alike and so is the Truth as presented in the Bible.  But again and again, I have to stress that CHRISTIAN TRUTH MUST NOT BE IN THE BIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED THE TRUTH. The CHURCH IS A LIVING FAITH; and THE CHURCH EXTENDS BEYOND BIBLICAL TIME- IT EXTENDS EVEN TILL NOW. There are lots of things that happened not only to Jesus (cf. Jn 20:30; 21:25) but also to the early Christians that were not documented in the Bible.  Take aside the Gospels (which only 4 out of several were canonically accepted) and the Acts of the Apostles, most of the writings of the New Testaments were Letters addressed to different Christian communities NOT THE STORY OF EVERYDAY LIFE OF THE EARLY CHURCH.  

Take for instance, apart from Judas Iscariot who committed suicide (cf. Acts 1:16-19), and James who was martyred by Herod Agrippa I in 44 AD (cf. Acts 12:1-2), there was no other Biblical records of the death of the other 10 Apostles.  In fact, the death of John the Beloved, Bartholomew and Simon the Canaanite were not exactly known in detail and the deaths of the other apostles (seven in number) are known through the tradition of the Church as reflected in the writings of early Christian historians. And of course, there were dark days in the life of the early Church where either there were no documentations or they lost the records.

The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which happened to be the oldest feast of Our Lady, was such incident in the Church with either non documented or lost record of the actually event.  However, there may be some biblical references and of course the writings of early Church fathers alluding to this great feast. 

What did the Church say about Assumption of BVM?
What is the origin of this feast?

Be Blessed.
18/08/2018, 13:36 - figo: ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN MARY, IS IT IN THE BIBLE? II

Again, while many Christians today would hold firm to the Bible as the ONLY TRUTH of Christian Church, many are unaware of what the Church has suffer even unto going into almost SILENCED sake for the Word of Christ Himself which states, “And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matt. 28:20).

Emperor Hadrian (76-138), around AD 135 leveled the City of Jerusalem and rebuilt it as Aelia Capitolina in honor of the god Jupiter.  And Jerusalem became practically a pagan city for two centuries that every memory of Jesus was eradicated from the city.  At this time, the early Christians like the recent trends would have thought that it was the end time.

For about 200 years, the City that was sanctified by the Life, Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ was filled with pagan temples and Christians could by no means openly talked about Christ. A lot of Christian practices and devotions were lost until Roman Emperor Constantine (c. 285-337) restored Jerusalem as a sacred city that the sacred sites began to be restored and the loving memories of the Lord became openly celebrated especially after the building of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in AD 336.

In the same vein, the celebration of Mary was lost with the dark ages and the persecution of Christians only to be brought back into memory with the “Tomb of Mary” tagged “Place of Dormition” (i.e the spot of Mary’s “falling asleep”) which was rediscovered close to Mount Zion, where the early Christian community had lived.
If they found the “Tomb of Mary” or “Place of Dormition” how come about the Assumption of Mary, mother of Jesus?

Be Blessed

If they found the “Tomb of Mary” or “Place of Dormition” how come about the Assumption of Mary?

At the time the “Tomb of Mary” was rediscovered, near Mount Zion where the early Christians once lived, the Memory of Mary began to be celebrated – as she herself has sang in the Magnificat, “From now on all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for me, holy is his name.” (Lk 1:48-49). But this wasn’t immediately celebrated as the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary but was only celebrated as “Memory of Mary” in Palestine and later celebrated in Rome as “Dormitio” or “Falling Asleep” of the Mother of God.

Notwithstanding, a belief about the Assumption of Mary was dated to the time of the apostles and rests on the fact that unlike any of the saints whose relics are present and are venerated throughout the Church, there were no relics of Mary to be venerated, and the said “Tomb of Mary” was an empty tomb near the site of her death.  

When Emperor Marcian requested for the relics of Mary at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the Patriarch of Jerusalem responded, “MARY HAD DIED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE APOSTLES; BUT HER TOMB, WHEN OPENED LATER . . . WAS FOUND EMPTY AND SO THE APOSTLES CONCLUDED THAT THE BODY WAS TAKEN UP INTO HEAVEN.", so there was no relics of her.

And according to the eighth century St. John Damascene, during his homily at the Tomb of Mary, he said of the body of Mary that,

"ALTHOUGH THE BODY WAS DULY BURIED, IT DID NOT REMAIN IN THE STATE OF DEATH, NEITHER WAS IT DISSOLVED BY DECAY. . . . YOU WERE TRANSFERRED TO YOUR HEAVENLY HOME, O LADY, QUEEN AND MOTHER OF GOD IN TRUTH."
 
If the apostles were aware of this, why was it not recorded in the Bible?
 
Be Blessed

21/08/2018, 00:08 - figo: ASSUMPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY, IS IT IN THE BIBLE? IV

If the apostles were aware of the death of the Blessed Virgin Mary, why was it not recorded in the Bible?

The last of the Apostles to die was John the Beloved, yet he did not state either in his Gospel or in his Apocalypse (Revelation) the death of any of the other apostles and not about the death of Mary the Mother of God whom he took home with him since after the death of Jesus (cf. Jn 19:25-27).  The reason is obvious, John wrote his Gospel so “THAT YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS THE MESSIAH, THE SON OF GOD, AND THAT BY BELIEVING YOU MAY HAVE LIFE IN HIS NAME.” (Jn 20:31).  Yet

-	No Christian can deny the fact that Mary conceived without sexual relations -  (cf. Is. 7:14; Matt 1:23) 
-	No Christian can deny that Mary is the Mother of the Lord  Jesus Christ – (cf. Lk. 1:43)
-	No Christian can deny that Mary was full of Grace – (cf. Lk. 1:28)
-	No Christian can deny that Mary was filled with the Holy Spirit – (Lk. 1:35; Acts 1:14)
-	No Christian can deny that Mary was there at the foundation of the Church (Act 1:14; 2)
-	And of course we know that Mary died
-	And no Christian can deny that Mary is in Heaven (cf. Jn 14:3; 3:36)

But was Mary taken to Heaven Body and Soul?  YES!

Is this in the Bible? NO!

YET, the fact that it was not in the Bible DOES NOT in any way remove the fact of the Assumption.  

IS ANYTHING IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD TO DO?  (cf> Gen 18:14; Jer.32:17;  Lk. 1:37; Matt 19:26)  - NO!

If God can take Enoch and Prophet Elijah to heaven without tasting death ( cf. Gen 5:24 and 2Kgs 2:11), and if God can make Mary to conceive Jesus Christ without any interaction with any man, Can God not take her, Body and Soul, to Heaven?  If her Body was preserved from Sin in other that she may bear God’s only Son, and she remains Holy, can God not preserve her body from corruption even after death?
21/08/2018, 00:08 - figo: Revelations 11:19  and 12:1-2  are not even the proof of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary as many think.  Rather, they prove that  
1.	Mary is in Heaven – 
2.	Mary is the Queen of Heaven (Coronation) –

The fact remains that, the “Tomb of Mary” was empty and there were no relics of her to be venerated by the early Christians.  For according to Father Canice, OFM Cap., “Relics of the Apostles and of thousands of martyrs are  preserved in richly adorned shrines and caskets. The sacred remains of Mary could not have been lost or neglected; that is a hypothesis which it would be impossible to entertain" 
 Her Assumption does not equal Ascension. For While Jesus by His own power went to Heaven, Mary was taken to Heaven by her Son.  If Jesus could raise Lazarus from the death after four days, will it be impossible for Him to take His Mother tou Himself?.  

DENYING THE ASSUMPTION OF MARY IS DENYING THAT GOD IS ABLE TO DO ALL THINGS. AND LOOKING FOR A BIBLICAL PROOF IS THE FIRST HAND OF FAITHLESSNESS. 

Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed (Jn 20:29)


Be Blessed.

Someone asks, “I am a very serious minded person who like to focus on any task given to me and not be distracted.  I find myself reading novels and mystery books with rapt attention.  But I am so worried because it seems I can’t get the same focus or attention when I am praying or in the Church…. I am so..so distracted by every little thing with my mind wandering here and there.  Why can I get the same kind of concentration as I do while doing my daily tasks or reading non-religious books?”

“Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful” (Josh 1:8)

When you get distracted in Church or when reading the Bible, what distracts you or what is the object of distraction? In most cases, it’s probably going to be something associated with the flesh in terms of suffering or pleasure.

Human mind is such that it spends more than ¾ of the day thinking about the affairs of the flesh without much distractions.  It spends less than ¼ of the day (if at all) to think of its Maker in the midst of multiple distractions.

The reason is obvious, we are too pre-occupied and carried away with worldly affairs and of course, the memory part of your brain stores them all as the pleasure center of the brain gets stimulated.  The information stored during your conscious or unconscious activities which stimulate the pleasure center of your brain then reveal itself when you try to pray or concentrate in the presence of God.  In other words, if you pre-occupied yourself always with worldly affairs, your mind cannot but tend to go in that direction.  That is why St Paul warms, “Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things” (Col 3:2), “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Lk 12:24).
21/08/2018, 22:32 - figo: In many situations, it is not the case that one wishes to think about worldly things or to get distracted while praying, but the mind abstracts whatever it can, irrespective of one’s willingness or desire to do so.

What can one do?

You don’t have to start struggling to fight the distraction for that itself is distracting; and yet do not have to accommodate it, else it becomes sinful and the Devil rejoices in that – RATHER CONVERT THOSE DISTRACTIONS INTO PRAYERS.  If it is your unfinished business at work that distracts you, pray that God gives you the grace and energy to finish up at the scheduled time. And if what distracts you is sexual in nature, thank God for making you feel human and pray that He grants you abundant grace, self-control and spirited heart to overcome temptation of the sexual desire. Or simply pray, “Get behind me Satan” (Lk 4:8; Matt 16:23).

If you live in God-consciousness, that “whatever you do, in word or deed, (you) do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Col 3:17), you will be less distracted because you are already united with Him in mind and heart all day; living in the Spirit. For “those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.” (Rom 8:5)

Always “Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.” (James 4:7-10)

Be Blessed.

22/08/2018, 15:48 - figo: WHERE SHOULD THE CATHOLIC WEDDING BE CELEBRATED, THE MAN’S CHURCH OR THE WOMAN'S CHURCH? 

This issue has caused so much disagreement between two people in serious relationship especially if they come from different cultures. Take for instant, if an Ibo Nigerian Man is marrying a Yoruba Nigerian Girl, this conflict may arise. The Ibos of the Eastern Nigeria have a custom of the wedding taking place in the Man’s Church/Parish. Among the Yoruba people of the Western part of the same country, the wedding takes place in the woman’s Church or the woman’s parents Church. However, the Catholic Church holds that “A marriage between Catholics or between a Catholic party and a non-Catholic baptized party is to be celebrated in a PARISH CHURCH. It can be celebrated in another church or oratory with the permission of the local ordinary or pastor” (Can. 1118 §1). By parish Church it means “Marriages are to be celebrated in a parish where EITHER of the contracting parties has a domicile, quasi-domicile, or months long residence or, if it concerns transients, in the parish where they actually reside” (Can. 1115).

In a marriage between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic, where the cultural custom concerning the place of wedding favors the baptized non-Catholic, the wedding may be celebrated in a non-Catholic Church with due procedure and the permission of the Bishop or Parish Priest.  The wedding celebration in a non-Catholic Church will require a dispensation from a canonical form from the local ordinary (Diocesan Bishop). According to Cannon 1121, § 3, "For a marriage contracted with a dispensation from canonical form, the local ordinary who granted the dispensation is to take care that the dispensation and celebration are inscribed in the marriage registers of both the curia and the proper parish of the Catholic party whose pastor conducted the investigation about the free status.
22/08/2018, 15:49 - figo: The Catholic spouse is bound to notify as soon as possible the same ordinary and pastor about the marriage celebrated and also to indicate the place of the celebration and the public form observed”.

22/08/2018, 16:45 - figo: MIXED MARRIAGE I


IF CELEBRATION OF MARRIAGE MAY BE ALLOWED IN ANOTHER CHURCH, WHY DOES THE CHURCH ALWAYS ASK THAT THE NON CATHOLIC PARTY BECOME A CATHOLIC? 

In the first place, there is no such law that mandated the non-Catholic to become a Catholic, HOWEVER,  the Church does not encourage marriage between a Catholic and a Baptized non-Catholic which is called Mixed Marriage, or between a Catholic and a non-Baptized person which is termed Disparity of Cult. However, if a Catholic finds his/her love outside the Catholic Church, the Church may permit such union if there is a just and reasonable cause; the Catholic party remains a Catholic and agreed to by the other party; they promise to have all the children born of such marriage baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church; both parties are instructed about the purposes and essential properties of marriage (cf. Can 1124 & 1125). 

The Church will rejoice if the non-Catholic party becomes a Catholic. The Church, however, does not compel and will not force the non-Catholic party to become a Catholic. There are different practices and rulings in many particular dioceses regarding this, for example: I have heard of cases where the parents of the Catholic party who married a non-Catholic are being stopped from the communion. I personally do not see any rational in this and there is nowhere in the Church’s Law where the parents of the bride (unfortunately not the groom) are punished for the sin of their daughter (if it is a sin at all- cf. Ezekiel 18). Could this be a way of telling the parents that they fail to train their children in the way of the Lord (cf. Prov. 22:6) or an interpretation of the saying: 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.'?
22/08/2018, 16:47 - figo: However, the Scriptures also say, “No longer will it be said: 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.' Instead everyone will die because of their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes will have his teeth set on edge!” (Jer. 31:29-30). If the Catholic party, male or female, promise to remain a Catholic, in order words, continue his or her sacramental life (even when the other party is not ready to be converted to Catholicism), he or she should neither be denied nor did anyone blame for his/her choice.

However, it must be noted that the celebration of the Sacrament of Marriage isn’t just a social thing but more a spiritual rite; of course, it is not a matter of fulfilling all righteousness as some people think. If either the bride or the groom will not continue the sacramental life by following the non-Catholic party to his or her church, then there is no need to have Catholic (sacramental) wedding.  I have seen a lot of young people and even their parents becoming so passionate about the place of the celebration of the wedding, considering the social implications; fighting the priest for saying the truth, BUT they care-less about the preservation of their FAITH.

What you have come to is Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,… (Heb. 12:23-24) 

Be Blessed.

22/08/2018, 17:37 - figo: MIXED MARRIAGE II


IF AFTER THE WEDDING OF THE NON-CATHOLIC MAN WHO HAD AGREED THAT THE CATHOLIC WIFE CONTINUES WITH HER CATHOLICISM, THE MAN DECIDED TO STOP THE CATHOLIC PARTNER FROM GOING TO CATHOLIC CHURCH – WHAT CAN THE CATHOLIC WIFE DO?
You see, the Church is neither wicked nor stupid to say that “Without express permission of the competent authority, marriage is PROHIBITED between two baptized persons of whom one is baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it after baptism and has not defected from it by a formal act and the other of whom is enrolled in a Church or ecclesial community not in full communion with the Catholic Church” (Can. 1124).  Experiences show that a man can do anything to win the heart of the woman he wishes to marry. Anything here includes lying and deception. So, it is not surprising to see a man to agree before marriage with the woman to continue being Catholic and when marriage is contracted, he turns around to say that the wife should follow him to his Church.
This does not mean that mixed marriage doesn’t work.  I have equally witnessed many marriages where it is either the man or the woman who is a Catholic and the other not. In many cases, all the children are Catholics, while in some cases they divide the children among themselves. In some situations, you will not even know that either of the party is not a Catholic because each time there is a celebration that involves the family, both of them come together. I have equally seen where the man drops the wife and the children in the Catholic Church and then continue to his own church.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MAN NOW ORDERED THE WIFE TO STOP GOING TO CATHOLIC CHURCH?
 In the first place, I may want to ask also: What could have made this man who had agreed in the first place to turn around and say he is no longer agreeing to such arrangement?
22/08/2018, 17:38 - figo: A lot of reasons come to mind: 
1. An attempt to prove to his family and friend that he is not a weakling and that he is the head of his household.
2. If his agreement is, in the first place, a deception to lead the woman to the state in which there is no going back. 
3. If the life of the wife is contrary to Gospel and the teaching of the Church.
4. If the man feels the Catholic Church is denying his wife or children whatever for whatever reason. Etc.
No matter what the situation may be, the man has no right to stop them from continuing from going to the Catholic Church. Remember that Can. 1125 states: “The local ordinary can grant a permission of this kind (MIXED MARRIAGE) if there is a just and reasonable cause. HE IS NOT TO GRANT IT UNLESS THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED:
1.	the Catholic party is to declare that he or she is prepared to remove dangers of defecting from the faith and is to make a sincere promise to do all in his or her power so that all offspring are baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church;
2.	 the other party is to be informed at an appropriate time about the promises which the Catholic party is to make, in such a way that it is certain that he or she is truly aware of the promise and obligation of the Catholic party; 
3.	both parties are to be instructed about the purposes and essential properties of marriage which neither of the contracting parties is to exclude. 

These promises to be made by the Catholic party are not to just to be verbalized but to be documented and signed by the Catholic Party who made them; and co-signed by the non-Catholic party and the priest. It is important to have some other people to witness this process – at least the Sponsors and if possible the parents of the intended couple.
22/08/2018, 17:40 - figo: It is sad however, to see the Catholic party whose faith the Church is trying to safeguard, fighting left and right that he or she has no promises or vows to make. You see them and their parents fighting the priest as if he is making life difficult for them.  Don't forget that the pastor of souls' primary assignment is the salvation of the souls of his flock. So he will not compromise that for anything.  I understand that there are some priests who do not take this aspect very serious and/or may not even explain this to their flock.

WHAT CAN THE CATHOLIC PARTY DO?

Be Blessed

IF AFTER THE WEDDING OF THE NON-CATHOLIC MAN WHO HAD AGREED THAT THE CATHOLIC WIFE CONTINUES WITH HER CATHOLICISM, THE MAN DECIDED TO STOP THE CATHOLIC PARTNER FROM GOING TO CATHOLIC CHURCH – WHAT CAN THE CATHOLIC WIFE DO?

The Church doesn't want to see you unhappy in your marriage, and there is no divorce in God's dictionary for God hates divorce (cf. Mal 2:16; Matt 19:6; 1 Core 7:10-11).

Get your priest informed and let him intervene. The church will do anything to safeguard your marriage. If the wife's behavior is the reason for change of mind, the wife should change her ways and live according to the Gospel in respect and obedience as the husband is also to respect and love his wife in obedience (cf. Eph 5;21ff; Philip 2:3)

However, if it is the case that the man consented to allow the wife to continue with her Catholic faith on deception, then there is no marriage in the first place; for marriage cannot be based on lies, force, or deceit (cf Can 1098). In this case annulment is possible - yet not encouraged.

The Wisdom is, avoid conflict of faith as you know that without faith, it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11:6). If you find love outside of your faith, be careful, for love isn’t the only ingredient for a happy marriage. 

Be Blessed.

Digital intelligence 101: Digital Marketing and Branding
Topic: TARGET AUDIENCE 
This video above is basically centered around knowing your 'Target Audience'.

In our digital era and thanks to key social media and networking platforms; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn, you can now specifically target your audience and measure your insights. 

What are INSIGHTS
Insights is/are an overall performance data of a content shared online. e.g Blogpost, Videos, pictures,music.

Alot of failed social media marketing campaign are due to inappropriate targeting. Instagram for example uses 'artificial intelligence' to assist you in targeting to your right audience, but then your audience may not be 100% predictable by Instagram, in subsequent posts, I will as well talk about 'artificial intelligence'

You need to be digitally intelligent to understand how to use little resources (i.e low budget) to achieve high conversation rate (in form of leads) via your social media marketing campaign. I will be sharing more on this in subsequent posts.

Below are a few tips to reaching your target audience 
-*Use of Keywords: in social media, this can be applied via the use of hashtags, while across other digital media, can be applied via just inputting multiple keywords and separating them with commas. Keywords are words that are linked to your brand or product you are selling 
E.g if you sell Human hair, your keywords should be ( wigs, synthetic, attachments, hair extensions, brazilianhair, peruvianhair etc) list as many as you can

-*Know and apply the age-bracket of your audience. For Products like mobile phones (London used and brand new) your age-bracket to target should be (16-45yrs). For Cars (23-45) (You can list your product/service in the comment section and I will give you an age bracket) 

-*Geolocation: The exact city, state(s), country(s) should as well be indicated. Be careful not select locations where your products are either not available in or not deliverable in

24/08/2018, 06:52 - figo: MARRIAGE AND AGE DIFFERENCES I

Is it possible for a lady to marry to a man who she is two or three years older than, and who is not as educated as she is? 

If you are asking about the possibility – YES – it is possible and it happens. However, Age, Position, Education, Financial status, Religion etc. have a lot to do with marriage. There is no one way of looking at this for the individual perception, cultural reactivity, and religious beliefs determine how one sees it. Let me reframe the question and split it into these questions: 
1.  Who should be older, the husband or the wife?
2.  Who should be richer, the husband or the wife? 
3.  Who should have higher education, the man or the woman? 

Answering these questions about who should be better than the other will take us to the controversial issue about gender equality. "So God created man in his image; in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." (Genesis 1:27) God “blessed them and called them Man on the day they were created."(Genesis 5:2). Will the present modern generation agree with man and woman being called MAN? Will they agree about women being submissive? (Eph. 5:22). 

Be Blessed

25/08/2018, 08:50 - Henry Osah: *WEEKEND WAKE-UP CALL*🗣🎙
_*Ezekiel 43:1-7 / Matthew 23:1-12*_

*One* of the songs 🎵 rocking the Nigeria 🇳🇬 airwaves 📻 presently is “Amaka” by 2Baba. Like everyone of his songs I have listened to it carefully and the beautiful message that come normally with the song. The song is simply about a straightforward guy and his double standard girl whose behaviour eventually affected everybody around the guy - the introduction party 🎉, DJ, his mother, father...

*One-sided* relationships never work, and never bring about happiness for couples✖. In relationships, both people should feel equally satisfied. There should always be balance and enough effort put into things by both ✌people.

*Double standard* is a set of principles ✍ establishing different provisions for one group than another. Anytime some are held to a higher standard than others, there's a double standard because everyone isn't being treated fairly 😔.

*In* today’s gospel 📖, Jesus speaks to the Scribes and the Pharisees about the double ✌standard, where people set the rules which they themselves do not keep: _”Do as I say, not as I do” or “You will do it because I tell you to do it.”_  And secondly, because everything they do is to attract attention to themselves. The holier than thou attitudes🙄, the double standard effort of making the outside clean and the inside left filthy.

*How* have really learnt in our contemporary age about all these❓We have actually gone so bad because everything now is about image🤩. How I want to be seen and perceived by the people. And the social media has helped negatively in this area too. The slavery to image is so pathetic. We worry about brand label on the clothes 👗 we wear weather it’s gucci, the drinks 🍷 if it’s hennessy, the places where we live, the cars 🚘 they drive ...

*And* it’s not as if we free from the “best place in the synagogue” and VIP syndrome too. We want special attention to be given to us, places of honour at banquets, special chieftaincy titles. Sadly 😔 it’s among church clerics, politicians, business leaders and the likes. 

*Jesus* is attacking 🗣not so much a particular people and we must look 👀 beyond the Scribes and the Pharisees and to ourselves. The Gospel is written for us and to us👌🏼.

_*Good morning 🌞 and have a beautiful weekend 🙋🏽‍♂.*_

You got angry in church and stopped being the member of the choir, left ushering, stopped sanctuary cleaning and every other work you were doing in church.
Eventually you've stopped going to the church because someone spoke to you in a way you didn't like...
Most of the messages from the pulpit was against you from your opinion...
Nobody called you when you were sick because according to you, "they do not love or care in the church..."
But pls excuse me...
You've not stopped working for the boss who insults you most of the time, neither have you stopped work because your colleagues spoke ill of you... (Money was the reason)
When you were sick, you didn't wait for your boss to call you or look for you at work. Rather, you called and told him about your present condition. No complaint about him not visiting you (Fear of query or loss of the job)
Do you remember that at school, your teachers, your schoolmates and or even your best friends offended you, yet you didn't stop schooling..
You can easily miss Church but not lectures because the lecturer will take attendance which counts in assessment
You can be late with your appointment with God at Church but you will be extra early for your visa interview at the embassy... �
Who are you deceiving?
I don't blame you too much. Maybe you don't know or you don't have adequate revelation about Church...
Please, Hear Me! Church is not a "No Offense Club" where all things must be done to please you and you alone.
What have you done in church for the good of others?
According to Scripture the first knowledge everybody must have about Church is that... It's *The House Of God* and *The Gate of Heaven*...
Genesis 28:17...
Your service to God must be with reverential fear, honor and respect.
God is watching... � _
Change your attitude.
Please forward to your contacts and let's effect a positive change for God

This is because of the beam that would be put across the road for the pedestrians.

During this period there would not be any movement within the axis.

The alternative routes are advised for those who deem it fit to move during this period.

TPRO, pls take note of this development.
25/08/2018, 23:30 - figo: MARRIAGE AND AGE DIFFERENCES II


Experiences across the world reveal that the husband is mostly perceived as older, richer, and with higher education. It is also true that there are instances where the wife is either older or richer or has higher education. While in the case of the man, all the factors – age, riches, and education – may be present, the woman is either older or richer or has higher education. The situation where the woman is older, richer and at the same time better educated is rare. The reason for this is obvious: nature has it that the male of many creatures is bigger, stronger, larger, and greater. No wonder in the Biblical account of creation, Man was created first; and it was from him that the woman was created (Gen 2:20-22). 

Consciously or unconsciously, women – even when they are more financially better than the man or older – they tend to be submissive and follow the lead of the husband. And I have seen women who are very educated who got married to someone who has no education though, the man may be richer. 

When you see a man or a woman, what do you first see? His/her age? His/her educational status? What do you first see? What attracts you to a person? What do you consider before you get married? I have seen many people who get along so well and promised to love each other forever, but the moment they are of the knowledge that the woman is older (even by a year) – either the man says he cannot continue or the woman considers herself too old to marry such a man. The love-love thing just dies down. Do you think the problem is the age? Or is it all about the riches or the education? Many times it is all about the socio-cultural factors and values. The thought of what your family will say, what your friends will say etc. What happens to all those feelings and those good times? Does love just wear out – just like that?

25/08/2018, 23:31 - figo: You should be in control of your life and what you want for yourself. Your father or mother will not live your marriage for you; and your friends will not live your life for you. Go for who you want. But if you feel that you cannot cope with your wife being older or your husband being younger, you may as well let it go. 

There is no rule that says a man must be older or the woman should be younger. “Age is a number” people say. It is not written on anyone’s head. And of course, your degrees are not written on your forehead. But if all these will make you feel inferior or superior to the other person, then you may have to reconsider your position. Remember that relationship is trying out – to see if it will work. Look beyond all these as they do not define the real person even though they are influential. Age, money and education will equally not guarantee happy marriage. 

Remember the Latin saying: OMNIA VINCIT AMOR –LOVE CONQUERS ALL. Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart (Prov. 3:3); Let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deeds and truth. We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before God (1 Jn. 3:18). 

Go for someone who makes you real, who you are in the flow with, who you love and cares about you, and patient with you. Go for the person who makes you happy despite the sonetimes misunderstanding. Go for inner beauty and values. Money,  education, and age are no guarantees of a happy marriage.

Be Blessed.

27/08/2018, 16:20 - ‪+234 909 477 0389‬: Five Branding Elements: #Name #Logo #Symbol #Package # Design

Gone are the days, when the first thing to do when a concept for a brand comes to your head is to search for its 'availability' in Corporate Affairs Commission (C.A.C) portal. 

Being Digitally smart, you should first of all check for the availability of your brand online!
Visit domain name providers like, GoDaddy or Name cheap or even Bluehost and check if your brand when affixed into 'www' is available. 

For example, if your brand name is 'abacha', check if www.abacha.com is available.

The reason why this is important or more important than company registeration is because any name can be used as a company, I.e your brand name can be different from your company name. 

For example your brand name is abacha and you are into sales of Glasses. Your company name can still be OPTICAL LENSES LIMITED. What you then need to do is to Trademark your 'abacha' brand to your company name with the Federal Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Abuja.

Marriage is one experience that almost everyone desires. It is that institution that is structured by personal world view, cultural values, religion, biases, etc. With all the studies and projections to promote happy and fruitful marriage, nature and nurture as they are understood by each person and the environment one lives in are yet to bring out a guaranteed happy marriage.  Marriage is as awesome as awful depending on the personalities and values of those who contract it.  Marriage is a reality of painful joy, laughing cries, and hateful love.  You are happy at a moment, you are sad the next moment.  You wake up feeling blessed, and you go to bed feeling cursed.  Marriage is like a beautiful rose flower with many thorns; the more it is enticing the more it pierces through ones emotions, and general relational wellbeing. It is the most desirable yet most problematic institution in the world.  Considering the marriage you are in or the one you observe – will you say it is A BLESSING, A CROSS, OR/AND A RESPONSIBILITY? 

Be Blessed

Marriage is an institution not only ordained by God but also blessed by Him (Gen 1:28; 5:2); entered into by two different people who consciously or unconsciously contribute into what that Marriage actually is.  There are as many marriages as many couples who contract them. And since human beings are uniquely different one from the other, so is Marriage uniquely different one from the other depending not just on the inputs of the couples involved but also on their reasons, beliefs, and values for contracting the marriage and of course, the environment they live in.

I have heard people say, “My Marriage is a Blessing”, “My marriage is Hell”, “My marriage is at a crossroad”, “My marriage is a Curse”, My marriage is a Cross”, “I have no regret in my marriage”, My marriage is a chore”, “I have no marriage”, “My marriage is a great responsibility” etc.  What all these talk about is not the different marriages themselves but the personal emotions/feelings one experiences in the marriage.  Marriage is a special “commitive” relationship that is entered into by a man and a woman, and so cannot be made up by only one person. Meaning, it is not appropriate to say “my marriage” as one will say “my family”.  

Marriage is not a property to be owned; rather, it is a life to be lived and a relationship that needs the efforts or inputs of the couple involved.  It is not a static situation, but a reality to be worked on for each second of the day.  Just as life is a blessing which is full of joy and sorrows, ups and downs, so is marriage. Which experience is more sustained depends on how you see your husband/wife, bear with each other, communicate and express your feelings, appreciate the little effort of the other, collaborate in things to be done, respects each other’s opinion, work for the common good, and of course, how you see God in your marriage.
28/08/2018, 17:16 - figo: Again, considering your marriage or the one you have observed – will you say it is A BLESSING, A CROSS, OR/AND A RESPONSIBILITY? 

Be Blessed.

29/08/2018, 12:26 - Chigozie Ali Cyaa: Must read

A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet. He held up a sign which said: "I am blind, please help." There were only a few coins in the hat. 

A man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words. Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy. 

That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were. The boy recognised his footsteps and asked, "Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?" The man said, "I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way. "I wrote: 'Today is a beautiful day; but I cannot see it.'"

Both signs told people that the boy was blind. But the first sign simply said the boy was blind. The second sign reminded people how fortunate they were to have their sight. 

Should we be surprised that the second sign was more effective?

Moral of the Story: Be thankful for what you have. Be creative. Be innovative. Think differently and positively. 

When life gives you a 100 reasons to cry, show life that you have 1000 reasons to smile. 

Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear. 

Keep the faith and drop the fear. It's a beautiful thing to see a person smiling. But even more beautiful if you are the reason for the smile!

Faith is not about everything turning out OK. Faith is about being OK no matter how things turn out. 

My prayer for you this morning,may you have reasons to appreciate the Lord.

If you appreciate this message, please share. You may touch someone's heart today and forever..

29/08/2018, 22:44 - figo: MARRIAGE: A BLESSING, A CROSS OR/AND A RESPONSIBILITY III


I was talking to a certain man who said that his marriage is a cross. I jokingly asked him, “Did you carry your wife on your wedding day?” He replied, “Yes”. “Are you still carrying her?” I asked again. With a little frown, he replied, “Oh no”. I pointed to the Photograph on the wall where he was carrying the wife and said “You still carry her, and you can’t drop her. It is a blessing to have her; and it is your responsibility to carry her all your life”. 

There are countless men and women out there, feeling neglected, rejected, dejected, and abandoned by God and everyone, and feeling as if something is wrong with them because they are yet to find who to marry. Some have all that it takes to make life enjoyable: good job, comfortable house, nice car, etc but they have no one to INTIMATELY FOREVER share and enjoy them with. Having someone to call your wife/husband; to rightfully lean on when your need someone; to hold you when you are abysmally cold; to lawfully share in your sexuality and sensuality; who joins with you to father/mother children – IS A BLESSING. 

Thank God you are married (cf. 1Thes 5:16-18). Being married gives you an identity of a responsible person and a status of an achiever. Marriage is a positive, blessed, and useful cross that has to be carried by husband and wife. The Cross strengthens your marriage, brings understanding, builds virtues, and leads to happiness. It makes you responsible. Jesus Christ says if anyone wants to be his disciple, let him/her carry his/her cross daily and follow him (cf. Matt 16:24). Carrying the Marriage Cross is a shared responsibility with no one leaving the effort to the other or expecting the other to ALWAYS do it. Your marriage is a blessing where you don’t have crosses but a Cross to be jointly carried.
29/08/2018, 22:45 - figo: I pray that you become strong in everything by a sharing of the Glory of God, so that you may have great endurance and persevere in joy. Constantly give thanks to the Father who has empowered you to receive your share in the inheritance of the saints in his kingdom of light (Colossians 1:11-12).

Be Blessed

30/08/2018, 07:42 - Ify Ikeogu: *Waiting On God*

*Joyce Meyer said once that “Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting*. 

This meditation from the 27th chapter of the Psalms will help you stop minding the time and cast your cares on Him who created time.

 
Let me pray now that you remember to not lose heart but be patient as you encounter the goodness of the Lord around you always. Wait on him.  Be courageous. Wait on him and he will strengthen your heart. Now may the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord show you His favor and give you His peace through Christ.  Amen.

 
In the days ahead you may experience some anxiety in waiting.  Be thankful to God for that awareness and in that moment breathe and be mindful of his presence around you.  There is no waiting because God is already present. And his presence is enough.

 
And consider too how you can be an example of patience to those around you. How might God work through you to be an example of His presence to others?  What a great calling for our world today.

 
So when you are ready, whether at the sunrise or sunset of your day, expect to wait.  And in so waiting, expect to encounter God.
*Have a blessed day*

Levy is actually 1k to take care of invited officials...prizes....foods and drinks, logistics, sports equipments etc

2k is for sports vest which is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL. You are not compelled to pay for that. The whole idea is to add colour to the day...which we will all witness.

Having said that...we can come with your team's colour of vest which you already have and participate for your team.

Names are being pasted by Oby to ginger us and not to force us

So go ahead and pay 1k to cover cost of event if you have not. It is our sports day and we all must enjoy it together.

Next day, when the carpenter came, *he ordered the sign boards to be swapped*. 

The sign board on the workers’ toilet displayed "Executives" and the Executives’ toilet displayed "Workers”.

Chairman then instructed this sign to be changed every fortnight.

The quality of both the toilets came at par in the next three days. 

Leaders listen with lots of patience and give solutions without wasting time.

"The Leadership is something much more than being an Executive"_*

30/08/2018, 20:07 - figo: ANNULMENT AND DIVORCE


IF A NON-CATHOLIC HUSBAND/WIFEQ DECIEVED THE CATHOLIC PARTY INTO MARRIAGE AND ALSO THREATENING THE CATHOLIC PARTY TO STOP CATHOLICISM; CAN THE CATHOLIC PARTY END THE MARRIAGE? 

He or she cannot immediately end the marriage. It is good to let the parish priest know –as soon as possible – what is happening to your faith as a Catholic. The Church works towards saving marriages – for what God has joined together, no one should separate (Matt 19:6). The priest will call for peaceful and understanding co-existence. 

However, if after said and done, it is discovered that the man/woman only tricked, or deceived the woman/man into marriage – where everything he/she had said he/she is and would do were lies – then it means that the marriage never existed even though celebrated. For “A person contracts invalidly who enters into a marriage deceived by malice, perpetrated to obtain consent, concerning some quality of the other partner which by its very nature can gravely disturb the partnership of conjugal life” (Can. 1098). In this case Annulment NOT divorce is possible. 

Annulment means a legal and ecclesiastical procedure for declaring a marriage null and void. I am NOT competent enough to deal with this situation as I am not a Canonist. I strongly advise that anyone in this situation should see his/her parish priest who may direct him/her to a Canon Lawyer or a member of the Marriage Tribunal in your particular diocese to make clear exactly what is going on – so that he can guide you on what to do.

WHAT IF BOTH ARE CATHOLICS AND THE MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, BUT AFTER THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY THE WIFE FINDS OUT THAT MOST OF WHAT THE HUSBAND TOLD HER BEFORE MARRIAGE ARE NOT TRUE; ALSO THAT THE MAN IS SUFFERING NO SPERM COUNT?
30/08/2018, 20:09 - figo: The same things apply as above. However, if after you discovered these lies, your faith is not challenged and your relationship is somewhat healthy, you can go on with your marriage and life continues. On the issue of the discovery of the “No Sperm Count” of the husband – this is not enough to make the marriage invalid. The question is: Is the man aware of this before or after the wedding? If this knowledge comes as a result of medical test in search of children as married couple then there is nothing to be done. The wife will have to bear this as a cross carried in love in acceptance of what they vowed: For Better for Worse; in Sickness and in Health - and of course wait for God’s miracle - for nothing is impossible for God (Luke 1:37; 18:27; Gen 18:14). 

But if it can be established that the man has the knowledge of this state of his before the wedding and hid it from the woman, then that makes the wedding invalid since deception is involved. This is similar to a situation an impotent man who hides under “fake spirituality” of no pre-marital sex so that the woman is unaware of his predicament. In the first place an impotent person is incapable of contracting marriage; if he does, such marriage is invalid. All that I am saying here is that, if knowing that your partner lied to you in other to get married to you poses a problem to your moral, spiritual, physical and mental well-being in marriage then you can free yourself following the right procedure as above. Otherwise, there is no need making problems out of the knowledge when indeed there may be no problem. 

“Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.” (Col 3:12-14, NIV) 

Be Blessed.

31/08/2018, 08:56 - figo: *Copied*

Tunji a handsome young guy had just had his morning dose of a packet of cigarette so he boarded the bus going from Ibadan to Lagos. Lucky for him his seat partner was a pretty girl , so he thought to use his Yoruba demon prowess to win his potential new catch. Everything was going on fine, dude had collected number.She was a final year Unilag student banking and finance.

Tunji was having a little cough and catarrh though, he thought it was embarrassing and lucky he hadn't felt the urge through out the conversation until he felt like sneezing.First sneeze and he held it and instead 'sneezed in'.The second sneeze, the same thing.At that second sneeze he heard a very loud sound like a thunder sound and immediately had a severe headache. Turns to his new catch and asks 'Did you hear that sound?  she replies 'nope'. Tunji thinks it's his imagination and journey continues.

The bus is in Lagos now, and Tunji all of a sudden is unconscious. They thought he was sleeping though, it was when everyone alighted and he didn't, they raised alarm, rushed him to the nearest hospital, where he was referred. They quickly did a CT scan and discovered he had bleeding in his brain. A blood vessel had ruptured. He slipped in a coma days later and died on the fourth day.

Sneezes are very powerful ,they could travel at a speed of 200 mph, that could rupture a blood vessel in your brain, perforate your ear drum or even cause air to be trapped in your chest between your lungs. Stop doing fine boy or fine girl, when you feel like sneezing, SNEEZE OUT.Turn the other way and sneeze out, don't try to sneeze in, it's dangerous.

*I think its  useful information*

01/09/2018, 07:04 - figo: I HATE DIVORCE 1


A man approached a woman and expressed that since the day he set his eyes on her, he was never the same so, he is in love. The woman stood in doubt, struggled over time, and accepted the proposal. This man could do anything for this woman to show his love. 
They got married after two years of courtship. And before God and Man they exchanged marriage vows saying to each other:
I (name), take you, (name), for my lawful wife/husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part (Rom 7:2)”. 

Ten years after, blessed with three kids, they seek divorce. 

The questions: 

Is it lawful for a man/woman to divorce his/her wife/husband for any and every reason? (Matt 19:3) 
What can your wife do to make you want to (or) send her away? 
What can make you to pack out of your husband’s house? 
What is the worst thing that can make you seek divorce? 
What was on your mind when you first met your partner? 
What was your dream about your marriage? 
What were you thinking when you were making your marriage vows? 
Why sudden change in the way you perceive the one you promised to spend the rest of your life with? 
How worst is the worst? 

Everything works well between you and your wife/husband as long as you are connected - understanding; appreciative; and attentive as Adam was, that he exclaimed, “This at last is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh" (Gen 2:23). Love may blind you to many realities; moving from reasoning to feelings: you become patient, so kind, jealous but not envious, not boastful, and not proud. You do not dishonor him/her, not selfish, not easily angered, and not taking record of wrongs; You avoid hurting each other, and yet truthful. You are protective, trust, hope, and persevere (Cf. 1 Cor. 13:4-7).
01/09/2018, 07:05 - figo: The moment you disconnect you give the devil the opportunity just as the moment either Adam or Eve disconnected with the other, Devil had a chance (cf. Gen 3:1-7; 1Pet 5:8-9), and then come blaming, accusations, misunderstanding, irritability, and suspicions. The moment you start cheating, you are disconnected. 

You are free to break relationship with your friend, your work place, even your children; but you are not free to do so with your wife/husband. Remember, though you are two, you are one body (Gen 2:24; Mk 10:7-8). Because God was a witness at your wedding (Malachi 2:14), there is a bond that exists between the husband and wife that no one can break; not even the two involved, ONLY death (Matt 19:6; Rom 7:2). It is disobedience to the will of God when you do so; and the Civil Society (as Moses) recognizing your stubbornness (cf. Matt 19:8). Thus, God may not listen to your prayers nor accept your offerings, for God hates divorce (Malachi 2: 13-16), for when you break faith with the wife/husband of your youth, you break faith with God.

What happens if it is evident that my wife/husband wants me dead, should I continue to stay with him/her? 

Be Blessed.

02/09/2018, 06:56 - figo: I HATE DIVORCE II


What will be your reaction waking up in the middle of the night and finding your husband/wife beside you with a knife? Why do you want to kill your husband/wife? What has he/she done to warrant not just the thought but the attempt?  When did this hatred feeling start? 

The feeling to kill the other party may be as a result of:
•	You have developed another love-life outside of your marriage, and so your partner becomes the obstacle 
•	Your husband/wife has so much wealth that you want to inherit 
•	You caught him/her in the very act, and maybe with your best friend 
•	You find him/her molesting your child or your step-child 
•	When he discovers the real father of the children 
•	When he/she becomes a real burden in health or in sickness 
•	When you are protecting a secret or discover you have been living with a LIE. 

The truth is you will not feel safe again because your life is on the edge of death. And yet, do not jump into conclusion. Remember "Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned” (Lk. 6:37); appearance is not the whole of reality (Jn. 7:24). A Patient person shows great understanding, but a quick-tempered one promotes foolishness (Prov. 14:29), and a hot-tempered person stirs up conflict, but the one who is patient calms a quarrel. But there is no way you will not be scared especially if you have skeletons in your cupboard; for there is no cause for fear if you have not violated the rule of right; Guilty conscience will always frisson in the presence of Truth/Reality. Whatever the case may be, real or looking real, or just seeming real - divorce shouldn’t be the immediate consideration.  There is nothing like divorce in the Church.

Be Blessed

It is said that no condition is permanent, so everything may not be rosy all the time. Having misunderstandings will be repeated events/experiences in your marriage. If you have never had quarrels or misunderstand of any sort, then one of you is lying or pretending. It doesn’t matter if you are a Pastor or the President of a Nation; a Counselor or Prophetess, there will always be issues that you will both not agree upon – what makes the difference is how you manage your differences. Your different upbringings will challenge your relationship/marriage. 

Some wisdom: 

•	According to Lauren Barnholdt, “The thing about loving someone, is that yelling at them only feels good while you're doing it -- as soon as they're gone, all you want to do is take it all back”. 
•	The Psalmist also says “Tremble, and do not sin; Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in the LORD (Ps 4:3-5). 
•	Jesus says,” For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you” (Matt 6:14). 
•	St Paul also said, Be angry, and do not sin; let not the sun set upon your wrath, do not give the devil the opportunity (Eph. 4:26-27). 
•	Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others (Col 3:13) 
•	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you (Eph. 4: 31-32). 
•	A person's wisdom yields patience; it is to one's glory to overlook an offense (Prov. 19:11) 

•	The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride (Eccl. 7:8)
02/09/2018, 14:10 - figo: However, if you still feel unsecured and the problem is escalating each day; the pastor couldn’t help; the counselor is tired – and then the Church says no divorce – and you can’t continue staying under the same roof; what should you do? 

Be Blessed

Every marriage and family is called to be at the service of life. 

Today, let's pray that all married couples and their families may be able to discern and discover how they can respect and uphold the dignity of life -- in whatever situation or circumstance they live in. 

Here are the prayers for today: 

Day 4 - The Novena for Marriage & Family

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Jesus, I trust in You. Please grant through Your mother’s intercession that I may always bring Your hope into my family.

Jesus, I trust in You. Please grant through Your mother’s intercession that I may always bring Your love into my family.

Jesus, I trust in You. Please grant through Your mother’s intercession that I may always bring Your mercy into my family.

Our Lady, on this upcoming feast of your birth, please pray for stronger and holier marriages.

Amen.

Oh most holy daughter of the line of King David, the Redeemer of the world loves you with the singular love of a Child for His mother. Pray for me today that the feast of your birth may give great joy to my soul that I may have a greater love and devotion to my Mother and Father.

Dearest Mother, please pray for me and for these my intentions…

(State your intentions)

Hail Mary, Full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

03/09/2018, 07:27 - figo: I HAVE DIVORCE IV


No one wants you dead. No one wants to see you wallowing in suffering. And of course the Church does not promote domestic violence instead, your comfort here on earth and in the kingdom of God. Again, a marriage (between baptized man and baptized woman) which is ratified (endorsed) and consummated (completed through sexual relations) cannot be dissolved by any human power or by any cause other than death (Cannon 1141; Rom 7:2-3; Malachi 2:16). However, for the good of both the husband and the wife, and the children, the Church allows SEPARATION (cf. Canon 1153). This does not mean that they are divorced, rather, that they can live separately while still remaining married. 

By implication, though they no longer stay under the same roof, this is no license to bring in another man/woman otherwise, you will be committing adultery (1Cor 7:39). The Church is willing to mediate between the couple to see that provision is always, and in good time, be made for the due maintenance and upbringing of the children; working on the innocent spouse to laudably readmit the other spouse (in forgiveness and pardoning) to the conjugal life, in which case he or she renounces the right to separation (Cannon 1154 & 1155) - and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control (1 Cor. 7:5). Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you (Eph. 4: 31-32). 

Think about your children. What are you teaching them? Remember, you are to teach them about love and forgiveness, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up (cf. Deut. 11:19). Do not frustrate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord (Eph. 6:4).
03/09/2018, 07:27 - figo: May the Lord heal all the hurts, and bring the broken marriages to worthy reconciliation. Give God a chance.

Be Blessed.

03/09/2018, 16:11 - figo: *DON’T WRITE YOUR SURNAME BEFORE YOUR FIRST NAME* 

People must understand that the arrangement of names is standard across the globe. When you’re asked to mention or write your name, call/write your first name first before any other names and the name that comes last is presumed to be your last name/surname. For example, if you’re James and your surname is John, in writing your name, write James John not the other way round.

All over the globe, the standard practice is:
First name 
Middle name(s) if any 
Surname or Last Name

However, if you write your surname first, always put comma so that readers can identify it as such. For example, if you write *John, James* a reader will know that John is your surname and James is your first name. 

Another acceptable practice is — you write your surname in caps and keep the first name in lower keys. For instance, *JOHN James* will communicate to every reader that your surname is John and your first name is James. 

Also, if you want to introduce yourself with your titles, mention the first name first in the sequence. For example; I am
*Prof/Dr./Rev./Mr. James John*
It tells a reader that James is your first name while John is your last. In instances where you mention your surname first after your title, don’t add your first name. For example, “Hello, I am Mr. John” don’t add your first name James. 

People are losing juicy jobs due to these minor mistakes they make at job interviews. Stop mentioning your surname before your first name. Surnames always come last that’s why in some jurisdictions, they specifically call it your *Last Name*.

04/09/2018, 18:55 - figo: If you have a daughter, girlfriend or a sister who's grown, always check on them. Give them money now and then to buy pads, under wears, and maybe toiletries. Females sometimes would never ask for these things from us, but they genuinely need them. They might ask from the wrong persons. 

If you have friends/relations who are students, call them sometimes, check on them. If you have #500 or #1000  give them. Life as a student sometimes gets really tough. Your kind gestures to them, goes a long way in helping them keep to a positive line. 

Men, if you have friends who are currently jobless, call them sometimes in solidarity. When going for a hair cut or shave sometimes,make them come along to get a hair cut or shaved too, while you pay. 

When recharging your phone, do recharge theirs too.  It may be nothing to you but sure means a lot to a jobless or poor fellow. Their ego wouldn't allow them to ask for it.

When your friends are into business, patronize and support them even when it means adding a little tip for them, please do it. It wouldn't cost you much.

Instead of buying beer for your friends, why dont you buy them food?

Sometimes, our friends, colleagues and maybe family,go through a lot but wouldn't dare tell us. Please give a helping hand today.

05/09/2018, 07:43 - ‪+234 803 802 6185‬: evening palava            A guy who just got married two weeks ago is se
eking for a divorce as a result of the wife's rude behaviour to his mother at the reception hall. 
What transpired was that on the wedding day,  when the wedding was almost ending, a couple from the mother in-laws' side came from a far distance to grace the occasion. They came in when everything tangible to offer them has finished. A portion of food the bride left for her parents was the only good delicacy left. The mother in-law went to the daughter in-law  and whispered to her to allow her collect small portion to serve those couple owing to the fact they came from a far distance to attend the wedding and it will be quiet unfair to let them go without offering food, but the lady refused bluntly that the food is for her parents. After series of pleading from the mother in-law with no positive response,  the mother in-law took a plate collected food from there to serve the guest. The daughter in-law took the food from her and poured it back to the cooler. Out of annoyance, the mother in-law slapped her and she slapped her back without hesitation. 

The people around the scene told the husband immediately what happened. The man decided not to create a scene at the reception hall.  Two days after he applied for a divorce.  The case is on-going now.  Despite the plea from his mother to forget and forgive the wife after all it was her the lady offended yet he refused. 

Did the man act right?  
If you are the man,  what will be your action?
If you're the lady,  was your action towards the mother in-law justified? 
  
So, ladies and gentlemen what is your take on this?

NB: True life story,  no fiction.

05/09/2018, 15:12 - Henry Osah: *Saint Teresa of Calcutta*

Saint of the Day for September 5
(August 26, 1910 – September 5, 1997)

Saint Teresa of Calcutta’s Story

Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the *tiny woman* recognized throughout the world for her work among the poorest of the poor, was beatified October 19, 2003. Among those present were hundreds of Missionaries of Charity, the order she founded in 1950, as a diocesan religious community. Today the congregation also includes contemplative sisters and brothers and an order of priests.

Born to Albanian parents in what is now Skopje, Macedonia, Gonxha (Agnes) Bojaxhiu was the youngest of the three children who survived. For a time, the family lived comfortably, and her father’s construction business thrived. But life changed overnight following his unexpected death.

During her years in public school, Agnes participated in a Catholic sodality and showed a strong interest in the foreign missions. At age 18, she entered the Loreto Sisters of Dublin. It was 1928 when she said goodbye to her mother for the final time and made her way to a new land and a new life. The following year she was sent to the Loreto novitiate in Darjeeling, India. There she chose the name Teresa and prepared for a life of service. She was assigned to a high school for girls in Calcutta, where she taught history and geography to the daughters of the wealthy. In 1944, she became the Principal of the school. But she could not escape the realities around her—the poverty, the suffering, the overwhelming numbers of destitute people.

In 1946, while riding a train to Darjeeling to make a retreat, Sister Teresa heard what she later explained as “a call within a call. The message was clear. I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them.” She also heard a call to give up her life with the Sisters of Loreto and instead, to “follow Christ into the slums to serve him among the poorest of the poor.”

After receiving permission to leave Loreto, establish a new religious community, and undertake her new work, Sister Teresa took a nursing course for several months. She returned to Calcutta, where she lived in the slums and opened a school for poor children. Dressed in a white sari and sandals–the ordinary dress of an Indian woman–she soon began getting to know her neighbors—especially the poor and sick—and getting to know their needs through visits.

The work was exhausting, but she was not alone for long. Volunteers who came to join her in the work, some of them former students, became the core of the Missionaries of Charity. Others helped by donating food, clothing, supplies, and the use of buildings. In 1952, the city of Calcutta gave Mother Teresa a former hostel, which became a home for the dying and the destitute. As the order expanded, services were also offered to orphans, abandoned children, alcoholics, the aging, and street people.

For the next four decades, Mother Teresa worked tirelessly on behalf of the poor. Her love knew no bounds. Nor did her energy, as she crisscrossed the globe pleading for support and inviting others to see the face of Jesus in the poorest of the poor. In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

In spite of increasingly severe health problems towards the end of her life, Mother Teresa continued to govern her Society and respond to the needs of the poor and the Church. By 1997, Mother Teresa's Sisters numbered nearly 4,000 members and were established in 610 foundations in 123 countries of the world. In March 1997 she blessed her newly-elected successor as Superior General of the Missionaries of Charity and then made one more trip abroad. After meeting Pope John Paul II for the last time, she returned to Calcutta and spent her final weeks receiving visitors and instructing her Sisters.

On September 5, 1997, God called her home. Blessed Teresa was canonized by Pope Francis on September 4, 2016.

 
*Reflection*
Mother Teresa’s beatification, just over six years after her death, was part of an expedited process put into effect by Pope John Paul II. Like so many others around the world, he found her love for the Eucharist, for prayer, and for the poor a model for all to emulate.

06/09/2018, 17:29 - figo: MARRIAGE OF A DIVORCE OR WIDOW III


A Muslim Imam once preached concerning three categories of marriage: Marriage to a Virgin, Marriage to a Married, Widow or Divorced person, and Marriage to a Flirt. He said that, when one is married to a virgin/unmarried, then that is one's real husband/wife. If married to a married, a widow or a divorced; one is married to another man/woman’s wife/husband; the father/mother of someone else. The one who marries a flirt marries the property of many people therefore one shouldn’t expect him/her to be faithful in marriage. 

While I am not in total agreement with him, I find some sense in it. The best bet is having your own husband/wife - brand new – a virgin as encouraged in the Bible - "He shall not take as wife a widow or a divorced woman or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a virgin of his own people," (cf. Lev 21:14; Ex 22:15). This is to avoid rivalry of any kind either with the children of the widow/divorced or with the wives/husbands and children of a polygamous/polyandry. "Let us not be conceited; let there be no rivalry or envy of one another." (Gal 5:26).

 If you find yourself in love with a flirt, Thus says the Lord, "Haughty are the women of Zion, walking with their heads held high, with mincing steps, flirting with their eyes, ornaments tinkling on their ankles" (Is 3:16); You should know that the flirt is a deep abyss and a narrow well (cf. Pro 23:27). Yet a flirt/prostitutes can change (Ez. 23:27) So if you cannot fall in love with the husbands, wives, children, sex partners of the polyandry, the polygamous, the widow/widower/divorced, and the flirt respectively, then reconsider the relationship you are establishing.
06/09/2018, 17:29 - figo: But if you can see the person you are marrying in his/her totality, with all that belong to him or her, and all the situations he or she is in, and you are ready to accept all these as part of your own life (Like Hosea in Hos 1) – there will be no problem at all – for his/her people and situation will be your people and situation. And life continues. 

Be Blessed

Please Inform Family Members In Nigeria. 

VERY IMPORTANT HEALTH INFORMATION. There is a huge volume of imported dangerous recycled cooking oil in circulation now in Nigeria. 

How to determine if a cooking oil is recycled oil. 

Place your cooking oil in the fridge for about 2 hours, if there is whitish bubbles or foam, you know then it is made from recycled engine oil waste materials. 

We need to spread the news to our loved ones. 

The simple test 2: Put a clove of garlic when about to fry, if the garlic turns red, that means the toxic level of recycled Oil is very high. 

Garlic will remain white if the oil is of good quality. 

Doctors have stressed that if all recipients of this message forward the same, we will help restore someone's health! 

Please spread the good news, do not leave the message in the box.

*Think about it!!*. 
The moment you get out of bed, wash your face, *Pure Water Companies* will be counting on
 you and when you brush your teeth, *Pepsodent, Macleans* or similar brands will be earning on you. 
When you Charge your phone *NEPA* will be reading their meter. When you move from your house  to the office,  *taxis, buses, Okada or Keke Napep owners*, if u are driving *Filling Station  Owners* will be collecting their share and when you check your *WhatsApp, Facebook* and other social media, telecommunication companies will be making money on you!

So before you get out of the house you have already paid all these companies something. You have already spent money. 
Let me not even talk about the rest of the day. *So if you are going to bed without making money*, how are you going to foot all these bills??.

*Food for thought*
Do something about your life today. 
Start thinking about how to make money everyday. *Think Residual Income* Start with a small targeted amount and grow as you go. Start with something that will give u even if its *50 Naira a day.*
*Its better than going to bed without making even a kobo*.
*Let's Put our faith into action, take risks and start something!*

*SALARY* alone can not solve your money problems. 
You need Secondary Source of income to balance.
*SALARY* is a *MEDICINE* for managing *POVERTY*, it doesn't *CURE* it. Only your *BUSINESS* or *INVESTMENT* Cures Poverty. 
Be Financially Intelligent...

One young man went to apply for a managerial position in a big company. 

He passed the initial interview, and now would meet the director for the final interview.

The director discovered from his CV that the youth's academic achievements were excellent.

He asked, Did you obtain any scholarships in school?
The youth answered "NO".

Who paid your school fees?
"My Parents ", he replied.

"Where do they work?"

"They worked as clothes cleaners.”

The director requested the youth to show his hands. 
The youth showed a pair of hands that were smooth and perfect.

"Have you ever helped your parents to wash the clothes?"

"Never, my parents always wanted me to study and read more books. Besides, my parents can wash clothes faster than me.

The director said, "I have a request. "When you go home today, go and clean your parents hands, and then see me tomorrow morning."

The youth felt dejected. 
When he got back home, he asked his parents to let him clean their hands. 
His parents felt strange, and happy. With mixed feelings, 
they showed their hands to their son.

The youth cleaned their hands slowly. He shed tears  as he did that. It was the first time he noticed that his parents hands were much wrinkled, and there were so many bruises on their hands.
Some bruises were so painful that they winced when he touched them. 

This was the first time the youth realized that it was these pairs of hands that washed the clothes everyday to enable him to pay the school fees. 

The bruises in the hands were the price that the parents had to pay for his education, his school activities and his future.

After cleaning his parents hands, the youth quietly washed all the remaining clothes for  them. 

That night, parents and son talked for a very long time.

Next morning, the youth went to the director's office.

The Director noticed the tears in the youth's eyes, when he asked: 

"Can you tell me what you did and learned yesterday in your house?"

The youth answered, I cleaned my parents hand, and also washed all the remaining clothes'! "I now know what appreciation is. 
Without my parents, I would not be who I am today".

By helping my parents yesterday, I realized how difficult and tough it would have been for me to get through school on my own. I have come to appreciate the importance and value of helping one’s family.

The director said, "This is what I am looking for in a manager. 
I want to recruit a person who can appreciate the help of others, a person who knows the sufferings of others to get things done, and a person who would not put money as his only goal in life.”

“You are hired.”

A child, who has been protected and habitually given whatever he wanted, would develop an "entitlement mentality" and would always put himself first. He would be ignorant of his parent's efforts. 

If we are this kind of protective parents, are we really showing love or are we destroying our children instead?

You can let your child live in a big house, eat a good meal,  watch on a big screen TV. But when you are cutting grass, please let them partake in it. 

After a meal, let them wash their plates and bowls together with their brothers and sisters. 

It is not  because you do not have money to hire a maid, but it is because you want to love them in the right way.

Let them understand, that no matter how rich their parents are, one day their hair will grow grey, same as the parents of that young man. 

The most important thing is for your child to learn how to appreciate the efforts of others, and experience the difficulties of hard labor, and learn the ability to work with others to get things done.

Pls forward this story to as many as possible. This may change somebody's life/attitude. I was touched by this and hope every one I forward this to will also be moved.

08/09/2018, 18:27 - figo: “SPIRIT HUSBAND”: A REALITY OR A MYTH? I


These days, many problems of a woman  – no job, no stable relationship, no marriage, examination failures, unproductive business on her part and the part of the husband, infertility, adulterous life, and her irreligiousity – are linked by some people to spiritual relationship to a certain spirit called the “Spirit Husband”. 

I have been severally asked if there is such being called “Spirit Husband”. 

Only on few occasions do people talk about “Spirit Wife”. 

Is this a Reality or a Myth?

For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places (Eph. 6:12)
Again, is “Spirit Husband/Wife” a Reality or a Myth?

Be Blessed

Please pass this on even if you do not have kids in school. Parents should know about this drug.This is a new drug known as 'strawberry quick '.There is a very scary thing going on in the schools right now that we all need to be aware of.There is a type of crystal meth going around that looks like strawberry pop rocks (the candy that sizzles and 'pops' in your mouth). It also smells like strawberry and it is being handed out to kids in school yards. They are calling it strawberry meth or strawberry quick.Kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the hospital in dire condition. It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange.Please instruct your children not to accept candy from strangers and even not to accept candy that looks like this from a friend (who may have been given it and believed it is candy) and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc. immediately.Pass this email on to as many people as you can (even if they don't have kids) so that we can raise awareness and hopefully prevent any tragedies from occurring..!!

Please Share To MaXimum to create awareness as it is realy helpful

09/09/2018, 21:21 - figo: “SPIRIT HUSBAND”: A REALITY OR A MYTH? II


Because this is a spiritual experience, it takes some sort of faith to believe the existence of such, and care not to inflict on oneself what is not there – and/ yet the person involved ought to know if s/he has such spiritual relationship which is most experienced during sleep. 
Many people have read through the common Bible and they couldn’t find anything of such or such term used in the Bible. However, reading through the Complete Bible (The Septuagint erronously called the Catholic Bible) gives an indication. The Book of Tobit Chapters 6 to 8 express this phenomenon very clearly about Sarah the daughter of Raguel, who had been married seven times. Each of the husband died the very night of their marriage being killed by the “Spirit Husband” who would forbid anyone to marry Sarah but would not harm her because the Spirit Husband loves her (Tob 6:14-16). Apart from this passage, there is no other place in the Bible. 

In all the cases of deliverance that Jesus dealt with in the Bible, there was no single case of “Spirit Husband”. The Apostles reported no such encounter and of course the early Christian certainly did not combat such spirits. Why is it so much talked about today especially in some parts of Africa? Is it because the Spirit Husband of Sarah ran to Egypt (In Africa) before Raphael caught him? (Tobit 8:3). Why is it that Catholics who have such reference in their Bible rarely talk about it and other Churches with no such reference in their Bible make it a reference point to some human problems?

Again, we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places (Eph. 6:12)

Be Blessed

10/09/2018, 12:59 - figo: “SPIRIT HUSBAND”: A REALITY OR A MYTH? III


The experience of “Spirit Husband” or “Spirit Wife” may take different dimensions depending on the “Spirit” and the person involved. 

•	The Spirit may have open relations with the person in which case one experiences constant visit of a particular figure of a person during sleep (in dreams). Sometimes, this Spirit may engage in romantic discussion, sexual relations, or may never say a word or do a thing. But the person involved is fully aware of this “strange” visit almost every night. This may include consistent dreaming of children one never had in a real world.

•	This Spirit may be a distant admirer who becomes “possessive” of the person – never got in contact with the person and yet gets angry at anyone who intrudes. In this situation, the Spirit may intrude into every relationship entered into by the person; never making the relationship work and ready to harm other intruders – like the case of Sarah (Tobit 6-8)

While the two instances can occur – it will be an error of over-generalization to think that every problem one encounters is as a result of one’s Spirit Husband or Spirit Wife. Or to think that every related dream confirms such.  You can imagine a very pretty lady with very bad attitude – while her beauty attracts men who may want to marry her; her bad attitude will surely drive them away. Or a very brilliant and dedicated man who equally is fond of stealing; while the employer may want to keep him because he is brilliant, his stealing behavior will always make him lose his jobs. Or infertility as a result of low-sperm count or no-sperm count.

Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear— but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. (1 Pet 3:3_4; Prov. 31:30-31)

Be Blessed

11/09/2018, 22:18 - figo: “SPIRIT HUSBAND”: A REALITY OR A MYTH? IV


Our attitude to want to blame someone else for our misdeeds like Adam would blame Eve and Eve blaming the Devil (Gen 3:11-13) (I don’t know who the Devil will blame) is promoting this idea of demonizing everything; making people not to be responsible for their actions even when one has been warned not to take a particular action because of the consequences like in the case of Cain (cf. Gen 4:7). Though the issue of “Spirit Husband/wife” is not void of reality, it is mostly mythicized, mystified and magnified by some Churches’ spirituality which in my opinion encourages people to live in fear in one hand and draw them to Jesus who constantly says – do not be afraid – on the other hand. And of course a way to sometimes extract money from people. It’s a strategy of evangelization/evangelism which makes people helpless, irresponsible and powerless; unconsciously bonding them more to fear while promising liberation – what a contradiction!!! 
Checking around the world, the “Spirit Husband/Wife” issue seems to occur in some non-Christian religious and cultural practices with no negative connotation rather a spiritual experience/relationship through dreams which brings fortunes. Christians across the world almost had no such experience; however a Christian or Muslim Nigerian considers such experience as a misfortune which requires deliverance.
One’s thought, belief, education, and environment influence what one’s reality is; in that one may experience as real what is unreal. Also while it is not impossible to have spiritual influences/manipulations/possession, man – in most cases – is the source of his own problem. Remember that as Christians the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world (1Jn 4:4). Any evil spirit cannot possess what God himself possesses (cf. James 4:7-8).

How then can one know he/she has "Spiritual Husband/Wife"? 
What is the way out?

Be Blessed.

12/09/2018, 20:48 - figo: “SPIRIT HUSBAND”: A REALITY OR A MYTH? V


From religious/spiritual point of view, “Spirit Husband/Wife” is a reality; yet it appears more as a myth or fiction from the ancient time. One of such fictitious Spirit Husband and Spirit Wife are Incubus (male) and Succubus (female) which appear in dreams and takes the nature of human person. 

However take note of the following: 
-  Having sexual relations in a dream is not enough indication of having “Spirit Husband/Wife” 
-  Having a wet dream is natural thus not an indication of relationship with a spirit. 
-  Dreaming of having children is not uncommon to those who love children. 
-  Not having stable relationship has something to do with your personality/attitude or luck rather than spiritual attack 
-  Not having children in your marriage is more biological than spiritual 
-  Having misfortunes or problems in life is just natural to human beings. 
-  Being promiscuous can be an effect of being abused or your own choice; result of poverty and/or possibility of being spiritually possessed.
-  Having a bad behavior is not an indication of possession – Judas, we know, was a thief yet an apostle – Jesus never saw him as possessed and He never performed deliverance on him (cf. Jn. 12:4-6). 
-  There is difference between Temptation and Possession.
-  James and John were sons of thunder (ancestral thing) – Jesus did not perform any deliverance on them; yet he rebuked their attitude (cf. Mk 3:17; Lk 9:54-55). 
-  Be careful not to let someone speak the Spirit Husband/Wife into you. Your search for the source and solution to your problem makes you very vulnerable to believing that you are possessed.
-  Having Spiritual relationship (with God) is healthy.

13/09/2018, 13:06 - Henry Osah: *THE STORY OF  ADÉGBÖRÒ* 

*ADEGBORO left Ibadan for Lagos in search of greener pasture. He chose to be carrying loads (Alabaru) on his head at Oyingbo market to earn a living.*

Few years after, he bought a cart from his savings and this eased the pain of carrying loads on his head for commercial purposes. The Cart also increased his income and he was able to acquire 6 more of its kind which he rented out to others.

*Exactly 8 years in this cart pushing business, Adegboro bought a van which many called BOLEKAJA and learning how to drive, he handled the business by himself. 4 years into the Bolekaja business, Adegboro had been a proud owner of 6 Vans.*

Being a bona fide Ibadan son, (omo bibi ilu Ibadan)  ADEGBORO built a magnificent building at OJA OBA where the Olubadan Palace was situated when it was time to put a roof on his head.

*Many people at this period approached Adegboro to show them the secret behind his success. He simply asked them if they could carry loads on their heads in the market to earn income (alabaru)? And their response had always been "NEVER".*

He too would spontaneously say *"ENI TI O LE SE ALABARU  L'OYINGBO, KO LE SE BI ADEGBORO L'OJA OBA"* - this is a replica of the adage also in Yoruba land that says; "ÌSASÙN tabi IKOKO TI YIO J'ATA (OBE), IDI RE A KOKO GBONA". (A pot that wants to consume a palatable soup must have its bottom burnt or heated with fire first).

In Life, to endure is to achieve. No short cut is sustainable. Wealth is built over time in a small bit but in a persistent way!!!!!! 
Our children must learn from this true life story. They must shun the get-rich-quick syndrome that's affecting most youths today, many have entered into traps of human traffickers, sold into sex slaves, drugs, prostitution, and what have you, in desperation for get-rich-quick green pastures. Today, many are still being auctioned for sale in LIBYA. 

 *Sit your children down and teach them the meaning of the popular poem by J.F. Odunjo:*

Se kii le pe lowo;
(Usually does not last)

Ohun ti a ba fara sise fun,
(Whatever gain one seriously labours for)

Nii pe lowo eni.
(Usually lasts with one)

Aye a ma ye o si terin-terin
(The world will celebrate you with smiles)

Je k’o de’ni tin rago
(Wait till you become poor)

Aye a ma yinmu si o
(The world will grimace at you)

Eko si’nso ni d’oga
(Education also elevates one to higher positions)

Mura ki o ko dara dara
(Ensure that you acquire it well)

Bi o si r’opo eniyan
(And if you see a lot of people)

Ti won f’eko s’erin rinrin
(Making mockery of education with laughter)

Dakun ma f’ara we won
(Please do not emulate or keep their company)

Iya n’bo fun’omo ti ko gbon
(Suffering beckons for the unwise child)

(Tears are due for the truant child)

Ma f’owuro sere ore mi
(Do not toy with your early years)

Mura si’se ojo’nlo
(Work hard; time waits for no one).

13/09/2018, 15:24 - figo: “SPIRIT HUSBAND”: A REALITY OR A MYTH? VI

TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE SPIRITUAL HUSBAND/WIFE 

-  Your life is contrary to the Gospel
- Your Dream experience is connected to your Real Life experience 
- The visit is constant, personal, and interactive. 
- The influence is directive and affective; that is, Bad things happen to anyone who is in relationship with you 
- Your spirit husband/wife supports you and makes things happen for you at ease. 
If you experience at least 4 of these – you may have spiritual husband/wife.

WHAT TO DO? 

- Strong personal decision to break up the relationship 
- Repent of your sins and be baptized (Be delivered)
- Allow God to direct your ways; Walk in the path of the Gospel 
And Jesus Christ will give you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy; nothing will ever harm you (Lk 10:19) 

Read these prayerfully - Ps 91; Mk 16:18; Jn. 17:12; Rom 16:19-20; Ez. 2:5-7; Lk 12:4)

Be Blessed
13/09/2018, 15:27 - figo: Summary is that there are spirit husbands/wives...but we need not fret as christians. Our God is bigger than any spirit husband/wife. Our approach to spiritual matters is very important. We need to trust in God at all times😇

You can be spiritual without being religious: but there is no way you will be religious without be spiritual

You can be religious without being  spiritual; but there is no way you will be spiritual without being religious

According to Dictionary.com, religion and spiritual are synonymous. In the past, there was no problem calling a religious person a spiritual person or associating someone with certain spiritual gifts with a particular religion.  In fact, when one talked about spirituality, it usually had to do with relationship with God or gods, in a religious sense.

The Twentieth Century understanding of the relationship between religion and spirituality has shifted, reaping religion of spirituality, and almost taking God out of the picture. Hence you hear expressions like:
- I am spiritual but not religious
- I am spiritual and have nothing to do with organized religion but I believe there is God
- I am a spiritual person, I don't believe in God 
- I am spiritual because I have connection with the universe
- I am a spiritual being because I love and respect human beings, animals and plants.
- I am a spiritual being because I do yoga
- I am spiritual because I find meaning in life
- I am spiritual because I am connected with my higher power (higher power is relative and can be anyone or anything)
- I am spiritual because I am connected with something greater than myself.

The questions are:
What is religion?
What is spirituality?
Can one be religious without being spiritual?
What is spiritual about spirituality?

"And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws" (Ez 36:27)

Be blessed.

_*1 Cor 12:12-14, 27-31 / Luke 7:11-17*_

*About* a week ago I started to notice a strange noice coming from inside the bonnet of the car 🚘. A very annoying noise that made me fear for the worse🙇🏻‍♂. It turned out to be one of the small rubber buttons that the bonnet rests. It must have fallen off while we were trying to sort out the bad battery. It got me wondering why the absence of such a tiny rubber cushion could cause so much noise🙄. Anyway, it might be small but it has its function in the entity called car 🚙.

*How* many parts does a car have❓Toyota website says a single car has about 30,000 parts, counting every part down to the smallest screws. Imagine all of them working together🤞 and that tiny rubber that have me headache 🤕 for days was among🙇🏻‍♂.

*How* About the human body - how many parts❓There are 78 organs in human body🕴🏻.The human body is made up of a head, neck, torso, two arms and two legs. The adult human body is made up of 100 trillion cells, 206 bones, 600 muscles, and 22 internal organs. Wao❗Imagine also all of them working together with the smallest bone 🍖 in the body. Do some of them even know they are very important❓Maybe that’s why the Church ⛪ is having issues moving forward ⏩.

*St. Paul* reminds us today that each one of us is a necessary part of the Body of Christ. We make the mistake of thinking 🤔 that the Body of Christ has status or hierarchical in nature. We are not passengers in Christ’s “car” but parts of His “car.” And Christ is the LIFE that puts all those parts into being. He proves that in today’s gospel 📖.

*At* the gate of Nain today, LIFE meets death. The dead boy⚰was being taken out while Jesus the LIFE  was coming in. Two separate crowds - one in mourning😭 and the other in joy😁. Jesus, however, changed the scenario. The crowd became one, death 💀 changed to life, and the two separate directions of the crowd became one as all turned back in to Naim❗👏🤗

*In* the face of all these, Jesus is telling us He is the head of the body, and that He has the last say👌🏼.

_*Good morning🌞 and enjoy your day*_🙋🏽‍♂

18/09/2018, 22:46 - figo: SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGIOUSITY 2 

Defining religion is as controversial as defining spirituality. In fact defining religion and spirituality has left many still scratching the head.

RELIGION according to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia, in a broader sense mean "the voluntary subjection of oneself to God".  The Catholic Dictionary sees  religion as "The moral virtue by which a person is disposed to render to God the worship and service he deserves" or "a composite of all the virtues that arise from a human being's relationship to God as the author of his or her being, even as love is a cluster of all the virtues arising from human response to God as the destiny of his or her being. Religion thus corresponds to the practice of piety toward God as Creator of the universe".

Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines religion as "a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices" or  "a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith".

In religion therefore, the following are necessary;
- God or Deity or the Divine
- Human beings' Relationship with God
- Faith or set of beliefs
- Moral Virtues
- Prayers, Rituals, and Rituals

While religion is a body of believers in God or gods or deites with a set of moral virtues or laws in a certain ritualistic model or worship, it is possible to have someone to be religious without even belonging to any religion. For to be religious is to be capable of having strong belief in someone or something, natural or supernatural, and be able hold on to it defensively or defenselessly. Hence, in a loose sense, Satanists, Atheists, and Scientists can be said to be religious with or without a religion.

Yet

"If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless" (James 1:26)


Be blessed.

20/09/2018, 13:04 - Ify Ikeogu: THE PREGNANT DEER 😢😢😢😢😢

In the forest a pregnant deer went near a flowing river in search of a good place to give birth, it finds the area safe. Suddenly labor pain begin! 
At the same moment the dark cloud🌇 fall and the lighting strike 🌌cause fire🔥 in the forest, when the dear turn left it saw a hunter creeping with an arrow pointed towards it, when it turns right the deer saw a hungry lion coming towards it, in front of the deer there where the flowing river was. What will this deer that is in pain do? 😬😬😬😬
Will she survive? 😟
Will she give birth to the fawn(young deers)? 
Will the fawns survive? 
Will the fire consume them? 
Will she died from the hunter's arrow? 
Or will the hungry lion tear her to pieces? 😢😢😢😢
The fire, the hunter, the lion and the river all surrounded her, what will she do? 
The deer has nothing to do so it focuses on giving birth to a new life. 
This is what happens as the deer give birth to the fawn 👇👇👇👇👇
_The lightning strike and put darkness in the eyes of the hunter. 
_he releases the arrow and it miss the deer and hit the hungry lion dead. 
_it starts to rain 🌉heavenly and the forest fire went off totally 😊😊😊
And the deer give birth to a healthy fawn👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

In life, there are times we are confronted with so many difficulties😕 that confuses our mind and give us negative thoughts and impossibilities, some of the thoughts are so powerful that it overcome and overwhelm us. Maybe we can learn from the pregnant dear👇👇👇👇👇

The only thing that was on the mind😇 of the deer at that time was to give birth to a baby. The rest wasn't in her hands, so any action or reaction that would have changed her focus that moment would have resulted in death or disaster. 

Ask yourself, where is your focus? 
Where's your faith or hope? 
In the midst of the storm, keep focus on your creator always, he will never ever forsake or let you down, NEVER ✖
Remember, your creator never make mistake(s), neither does he sleeps. 
A strong 💪person always keep their focus, even with tears 😢running down their eyes, they always say I am OK with a smile😁. 

I sent this to you because I want you to be strong 💪and keep the faith, so share it on your time line that someone can read it too and be strong..

20/09/2018, 20:56 - figo: SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGIOUSITY 3

Different fields of life define certain concepts differently. It will not be fair in anyway to want to use the secular understanding of spirituality today to override the traditional religious understanding of spirituality. Truth is One and Objective; realities of the same Truth can vary and may be subjective. So, it will be an error mixing the definition and understanding of spirituality from religious point of view with the secular understanding. For within religious spheres, there are different spiritualities. 

Yes, spirituality may be defined as man's search for meaning, as portrayed by Victor E Frankl, this meaning for a religious person is found in God his/her Creator. This meaning is not void of happiness and rest which a Christian seeks not only in this timely corporeal world but more so unto eternity in God's kingdom. A Christian for example knows that this does not consist in mere affiliation with God through worship and service, rather by doing the will of God.  In other words, it is not enough to be religious, one should follow the spirit of the religion which is to love God and love neighbors (friends and enemies - cf. Matt 5:43; Lec 19:18); living not in division but in unity (cf. Jn.17;21).

So, while it is possible to be spiritual without belonging to a religious group, yet doing things religiously, a true religious person is not only spiritual by nature but also practices in the spirit of the religion. Jesus Christ thus says,

"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." (Matt. 7;21). And the God we see is everyone (cf. Matt 25:40). For "whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen" (1 Jn. 4;20).

I am religiously spiritual.

Be Blessed

22/09/2018, 20:43 - figo: COUNSELLING TIPS
(For Teenagers)
Fr. Ozoh' Joseph Nwokeforo. 

These tips can be applied by parents, teachers, youth leaders, and those involved in Teens Evangelism.

1. Be a good listener. Listen attentively to what they have to say and treat it as important.

2. Emphasize the need to give absolute priority to God in their lives.

3. Try to understand what the root cause if their complaint could be. 

4. Showing good example as a counselor will be more effective than being authoritarian or dishing out punishment.

5. Don't compromise, moral values should be emphasized. Teens respect those who guide them firmly but calmly.

6. Be Trustworthy yourself and show that you trust them as capable of good behavior.

7. Don't label them as 'bad eggs', else they end up conforming to that nature.

8. Emphasis on their strengths rather than their weaknesses and shortcomings.

9. Appreciate, Encourage, and accept them even when they occasionally fail.

10. Perfection is a gradual journey, do not overburden them with assignments, responsibilities, and duties; allow them enjoy their teenage days.

11. Be Patient and understanding.

12. Avoid public condemnation, this may drive them far away from you.

13. Edify- Make them know they are important to their families, Church and Society.

14. God is Love. Make them feel that God's forgiveness is always possible and he gives opportunities to become better.

15. Teach them not to take God's silence for granted. He knows all and sees all.

16. Bible Studies. Make them understand that the Word of God comes first.

17. Lay Emphasis on Making STRONG RESOLVE to detach from old habits.

18. Prayer and Reflection in the Blessed Sacrament is an important part of their daily lives.

19. Impart sound sex education. Many Teens fall into problems due to lack of knowledge about the implications of sex, and the plan of God regarding love and sex (Procreation and Companionship for couples).

FR. Ozoh' is:

It is not uncommon to hear people say that we all are addicted to something or someone: addicted to work, addicted to alcohol and drugs, addicted to mobile phone and internet, addicted to a particular food, addicted to particular dress or shoes, addicted to a boyfriend or girlfriend, addicted to sex and pornography, addicted to an addict, etc.  While it is true that one can be addicted to any of the situations above, it may be interesting to know that some people who are thought to be addicted to something or someone may actually not be addicted. 

In recent time, in order to justify the claim that everyone is addicted to something or someone, the term "Positive Addiction" emerged. Positive addiction refers to addiction to good things like physical exercises, religious or spiritual practices like meditation, books reading, breathing, school, Church, Masque etc

Is doing something over and over again addiction?
Is habit the same as addiction?
Is loving, liking, or fond of something addiction?
Is deriving pleasure in doing something addiction?
Is using something to escape reality addiction?
Can there be positive addiction?
What exactly is addiction?

"We are allowed to do anything," so they say. That is true, but not everything is good. "We are allowed to do anything" - but not everything is helpful" (1 Cor 10:23; GNT)

Heavenly Father, we are so blessed to be your children, we praise and thank You for always being there as our guard and guide, our defence and defender. Father we ask that You look down in grace and mercy on all single men and women who have an inner yearnings and desire to be married and yet have remained single, we pray that You look  with compassion on the desires of our hearts and bring into our life a person of Your choice with whom they can share their life and their future together. Teach us Lord to listen to the promptings of Your voice, so that we may live by faith and not by sight.

We pray that this year's Single's Forum will bring divine blessings and unlimited favour, in joy and happiness, all these we pray through Christ our Lord. Amen.

It is good we come early, as we dont want Fr Wilfred Nwachukwu to come by 7am to kick off the event and start waiting for us. This will be a good incentive to boost our chances and at the same time ensure punctuality
Sports comm....i suggest to ensure transparency in this regard.  Once a team is up to 15...they snap a group picture, all in their jersey and post on the general portal to time check it😁

My name is Kamsiyochukwu.I am 24 years old and the only daughter of my parents. We live at Adelabu street Surulere Lagos.Last year, 2017,I met a man called James Omorodion living in shevron estate,lekki Laos.I use to visit one of my friend there every weekend,then on one of such weekends,I met james driving out of the estate and he stopped me and my friend.After much greetings,he told my friend that he likes me and to cut the long story short,one thing led to another we started dating.The man is very rich,He lives in a very big duplex of his own and drives different exotic cars.I visit him every weekend and sometimes spend the nights week days when wants to see me.He was so nice and was buying me many things,he changed my life and paid all my out standing fees in the university.Within the few weeks we started dating he bought me a Range Rover evogue and put 2million naira for me in my account,He Used a very expensive Ring to propose to me,an iPhone 7,and many other gifts.On the day of my formal native introduction that he met my parents to ask forvmy hand in marriage he bought them so many things and gave them plenty money.8months later,we got married which was march this year.My Wedding and my  traditional was done the same day in my village.Am from orlu in imo state and he is from Ekpoma Edo state.We came back to lagos with a flight and same day he bought my parents a Lovely car and told them he will be taking me to America the next day for honeymoon.So on our way to lekki his house,i asked him how we will be go America the next day when I have no visa or even international passport yet.He told me never to worry that he can get everything in less than 8 hours,that is obvious i dont know that i am married to a King that if i know how connected he is then i should count myself as one of the luckiest women on earth.I didn't doubt cos he is very very rich.The night we got back,he made love to me passionately like a new bride.The next day,after he got ready for work,he told me to follow him to an empty room in the house which i always ask him why the room has no bed and nothing inside some months ago and why he didn’t furnish the room like the rest,but he waved it off.i was trying to unpack,when he told me to leave my clothes and follow him.When we got into the empty room,he told me to remove my clothes and hand it over to him,I was surprised and asked what for,the next thing I know was for him to give me a hot slap,the nice man i dated 5months and married turned into a beast in my presence.He Beat me and stripped me naked then he raped me and locked me inside the room on bare cold floor and left.I was there till he came back in the night and unlocked the door without saying anything then dropped me a plate of rice and a plastic spoon with bottled water.And locked back the door,i didn't know what to do,i dint understand anything so i ate the food.The only thing in the room is toilet and bathroom,no towel,no soap,no mattress or blanket just an empty room.That same night in the darkness,he walked in and flogged me 12 strokes of cane,he raped me again and left.Each time i try to talk to him or beg him,he will punch my face so I stopped talking.i became dumb and lost.
This continued happening every night,for so many days I lost count,after he brings me food,he will leave for some hours and come back again to flog me and rape me.I screamed,cried and beg but nobody came to my rescue.I had already given up and was praying for death to take me away.I got sick and i thought he will pity me or give me a blanket to cover myself and stop sleeping naked on the cold tiled floor.But he did not.He still flogs me and rape me upon how hot my body was until one night i started to bleed heavily and lost consciousness,when I later open my eyes i saw him with another man telling him that I lost the baby,I was wondering which baby,that was when I knew i got pregnant and lost it in that process.After the man gave me some drugs and injections,both of them left,he came back later with some food and mop to clean up the blood and took me into bathroom to bathe me and left me.All my body was sore from the flogging and hitting with raping.I didn't see him again until the next night when he brought food and came back to flog and rape me again as usual.Anytime am seeing my period,he rapes me like that with the blood.I was seeing my period on the floor he refused giving me sanitary pad or tissues he will tell me shut up that i should allow the menstruation on the floor,he comes in every night to clean off the blood with a new white towel that i really do not understand.i lost count of how long i was locked abused.He never had any visitor.I kept wondering what he told my parents.i got pregnant two times but lost both.One day i heard someone whistling close to the window where I was,then I started shouting and hitting the window hard with all my strength,until the person looked up and asked na who be that?That was when I recognised the voice as that of his gate man.So I started shouting his name and begging him to help me that my husband want to kill me.So he said when did i come back from America and how did I pass the gate that he did not see me.I kept begging and crying for his help.At first he refused to help saying oga warned him not to near the main building no matter what. But his tap stopped rushing so he quickly rushed to fetch water from the main building before he heard my voice.I continued to cry and convince him that I was dying until he agreed.He left and came back to tell me that the door to the main house is locked but that he will go and get someone to help him break down the door. That was how he and one other guy broke down the door and came upstairs and still break the room i was locked in and they saw me naked,It was the aboki that ran to his gate house to get me his cloth he gave me his trouser and shirt that wore out of the house after they put me in a cab that brought me back home.The aboki also left the same day.My family couldn’t recognise me when they saw me. I was rushed to the hospital and that was where I told them everything that happened to me.My family said he visits them every two weeks to give them goodies,he lied to them that I sent them from America that he left me with his elder sister in the us cos he got an urgent call for business that made him return without me and that I will be back in a month time,he kept deceiving my parents each week he visited them,but refused to give them phone number to contact me.He was using lies upon lies to cover up. My dad arrested him that same day,he claimed I was lying against him that am just after his money,even with all the marks of the numerous flogging on my body with all the cuts on my lips. That same night after his arrest,his lawyer went to bail him and he was released.This man held me captive and tortured me from March this year to August and he is getting away with it because he is very rich and we are poor,even the police can't do anything about this they kept collecting money from us and tell us to go home that they will keep  investigating.The man even warned my father that we should move on with our lives and keep our mouths shut if we don't want him to kill us and if he hears this matter anywhere further that he will kill me by any means.But I can't keep quiet and let him go like that.I ve been following you,I am ready to go any length to get justice. Please i am very bitter help me,this man ruined my life and destroyed my body.I need justice. There's more to this story,but I don't want to get you tired of reading. Reply me pls,for me to know I can call you if you can give me your number and would also like to see and show you evidences.
Please "

25/09/2018, 20:48 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: _BRIEF HISTORY OF ST. FRANCIS_

 Francis was born *Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone*, to a rich silk merchant on 1181 AD. His 
nickname “Francesco” means “the Frenchman”, given by his father probably because of his 
love for anything French. His mother was a French woman of noble birth. 

He became a soldier early in life and fought for Assisi. In 1204, while recovering from an 
illness, he had a vision of which caused him to return to Assisi. There his spiritual awakening 
followed. He spent a lot of time asking God for direction and caring for poor people, including 
lepers. 

Another vision followed of Christ asking him to repair His church. St. Francis perceived this as directing him to repair a local church, so he sold cloth from his father’s store to help fund the 
repairs. His father became angry, so St. Francis renounced all worldly possession and spent his time as a beggar, restoring many other churches in the area. 

In 1209, after hearing a sermon about preaching the Good News, he started doing just that 
and living in poverty. Other friends, mostly from the educated class, who joined his life as a 
beggar, soon joined him. One of the most famous saints he inspired was St. Clare of Assisi, with whom he co-founded the women’s order of the Poor Clares. 

He is renowned for his love of animals, the environment, and his desire for peace. He even went to see the Muslim leader of Egypt to seek peace. 
He was graced with the stigmata shortly before his death on Oct. 3, 1226. He died singing 
psalms of praise. 

Pope Gregory IX canonized him on July 16, 1228. 
His feast day is celebrated on *October 4th*

LOVE
THE ONLY PERFECT GIFT (1 COR. 13:1-13)

Uncle Paul in h is Letter to the Corinthians spoke about the meaning, importance, and gain of the gift of love. He described LOVE as the only complete and perfect gift. Possessing or desiring the gift of prophesy, speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, faith, healing, miracles, wisdom, knowledge, discerning of Spirit are wonderful, but having them without love he described as a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. To him, these gift are imperfect in nature, one with the gift of prophesy, may prophesy and may not happen as it is said, same with the others, which he says comes in part, except for love with is perfect. For these gifts he says will cease, they will be done with only love remains, it will not cease, even in the face of trials and challenges.

We too can be referred to as a noisy gong, if in our various spheres of life, that is in our personal existence, our life with family, friends, others, as an employer/CEO, employee, a leader/member of a society, in whatever sphere we function we become a  gong if we do not speak or practice in love. 

To say the truth, we are all guilty of not speaking or practicing love, I remember one of the times I was standing by the busstop and a car drives splashing water on me, and to add pepper to the injury, I was wearing white I did not know when I shouted, “it will not be well with you, God go punish you, foolish idiot……..” I mean,  if love dwells in me, maybe it would have gotten a better part of me, I would just put a hold on my mouth, or understand that it wasn’t a deliberate act, I was actually a GONG that day and other days I cannot remember, and sometimes too I am still a gong, you too can take a while to remember those times we acted like a noisy gong,  towards family members, our friends, employer, employee, our dear ones, followers, ourselves even our enemies. Today Uncle Paul encourages us to aspire the gift of love to open our heart to it and to pursue it, for it is the greatest kind of gift anyone will ever have.  May God grant us the grace to always desire his gift of love and help us to practice it in sincerity. Amen
25/09/2018, 21:04 - figo: *Concluding Prayer*

26/09/2018, 08:59 - Henry Osah: The brutal words of Richard Smith, famous British guitarist, during an interview ...
😦😦😦😦😦😦
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
I have been asked many times what I think of Africans, here is what I think of Africans, without language and without taboos.

*They sell everything to the highest bidder, even the land. Then they poison themselves with everything that is edible.*

*I am not racist because I do not believe for a single second that I am superior to a black man. The difference with them is that we think of our descendants, we are calculators, we protect our interests and we'll kill for that if need be*.

*We are not emotional, we have passed this stage. If the lion has pity on the gazelle, it is he who will die of hunger. They have lions at home, but they do not understand the laws of nature.*

*For everything, they confide in superstition and religion. The difference between the others and blacks is, while others reflect, blacks do not think, they do not use their intellectual capacity and very few blacks are analytical.*

*And when a few black people pierce through, we admit them to our side or eliminate them in one way or another, most often, with the hand of other blacks.*

*We brought them our god and continuously invent fuzzy concepts to confuse them more.*

*In a hundred years, their descendants will be more slaves than they are now. They are already more unhappy than the generation of their parents, and they naively believe that numbers will be their strength.*

*Just watch how they drown at sea to come here. We conquered them with a few tens of ours and the active help of theirs.*

*We forced them to speak and write in our languages. We will control their descendants more than we control them right now.*

*Other people understood our game, they started to use the same technical knowledge as us to protect and dissuade, but the blacks did not understand anything.*

*I'm sorry to be so brutal in my franchise. Nothing personal, I'm just plain."*

26/09/2018, 20:55 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *MEDITATION*

*JOY* is one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit. It is not a special gift given to a selected few;  it is simply a by-product of living in God. A look at some Scriptural passages shows that *joy* is always connected, not to the world, but to the faith and to God:
 - Ps 30:11 says "You have turned my mourning into *joyful* dancing. You have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with *joy*"
 - Romans 14:17 – For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and *joy* in the Holy Spirit
 - Romans  15:13 – May the God of hope fill you with all *joy* and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit

However, most times when we think of a saint, the first image that comes to mind is a sad, pale, thin figure, often tortured and in pain. Even Holy pictures & statues don't help much as lots of them depict the saints and the entire Holy Family looking miserable and weak with tears. 😀

The truth is the saints lived in God’s presence and in His *joy*. St. Francis of Assisi, is considered the most famous, *joyful* saint. He used to praise "God the Artist" in every one of God’s works. Whatever joy he found in things made he referred to their maker. He rejoiced in all the works of God’s hands. He called animals “brother” or “sister". He would go through the streets, inviting everyone to sing with him. Now, if that is not being joyful, what then is?

The joy referred to here is more than a passing worldly joy. It is deeper than an emotional experience. It is rooted in God and comes from Him. Since it does not originate from the world but, rather, from God, it is more *serene* and *stable* than worldly joy, which is merely emotional and lasts only for a time. 

*Joy is the sign of the presence of God in our lives. It never wavers in bad times: it is the source of our strength. 💪🏽 (Nehemiah 8:10)*

_Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there's sadness, let me bring *JOY*. Amen._🙏🏼

Peace be with you!

Day3 - Today, let's pray for *Kindness*- Lord, give me a kind heart that will endure. To help someone along the way, to lend a helping hand to someone whose life has not gone as planned. To reach out to someone in need and to make out time to care.

*Opening Prayer* 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. 

Holy Saint Francis, through your kind intercession we seek holiness above all things. We seek the faith, hope and love that allowed you to joyfully renounce the pleasures of earthly life and to radically follow our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Pray for us that we enjoy the privilege of suffering with and for the poor in the example of Jesus. Help us to be always grateful for the all blessings we have received and the strength to overcome our most pressing concerns, especially… 
(Mention your intentions here)

*Prayer*

Glorious St. Francis, you have acted as a peacemaker even in the face of extreme physical danger. Through your prayers, may we also be imbued with a desire to find peaceful resolutions to the problems that plague us, even in the most trying of times. As an offering to our Almighty Father, I resolve to forgive all the wrongs I have suffered from my fellow men.

27/09/2018, 20:52 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *MEDITATION*

*Kindness*, implies a more active expression of love towards God and fellow man. In most cases, *kindness* is not beyond any of us because it usually costs no money. It may take the sacrifice of time and energy. It may require the discipline to be thoughtful of others' needs and to make the effort to act.

The consequences of *kindness* are incalculable, for such a spirit can ripple out to touch the lives of those far removed from the original act. *Kindness* sows the seeds that can only bear good fruit.
It can be done if we will choose to humble ourselves and act when we become aware of the need of a brother or of the church itself. God calls upon us here not merely to act but to do it with affection. In all cases, we must let our heart dictate to our hand, to let our most tender feelings encounter the miseries of those in distress, just as Christ did in descending to clothe Himself in clay.

 We need to let our feelings be at hand and readily touched that we might open our hands wide in help.

It is encouraging to note Jesus' ringing promise in Matthew 5:7: "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." This parallels something David writes in psalm 41:1-3: Blessed is he who considers the poor; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, and he will be blessed on the earth; You will not deliver him to the will of his enemies. The Lord will strengthen him on his bed of illness; You will sustain him on his sickbed.

This should not be the major reason for being kind. Yet God, who is ever ready to give and bless, has of His own will inspired these words for our benefit, so we understand that our efforts in glorifying Him and His way do not go unnoticed. 

May God grant us the grace to be kind to one another in order to make the world a better place.🙏🏽
27/09/2018, 20:52 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *Concluding Prayer* 

St. Francis, help us in praying for the grace to truly repent for our sins and actively seek reconciliation with God. May the blessings we obtain through your intercession deepen our faith, and inspire us to store treasures in Heaven, where we hope to spend eternity with the Almighty Father. 

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and forever shall be, world without end. Amen 

St. Francis of Assisi, Pray for us! 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

 *Gentleness* Is a great attribute of a wise being. It simple connotes  meekness but mistaken for weakness. This fruit of Wisdom, given by the Holy Spirit, enables us to completely submit to God as Lord of our lives. 

*Gentleness* places our strength under God's guidance; it is a powerful tool for God's kingdom.
Every person is powerful, but to be gentle is to recognize that we have limitations and that God's ways and thoughts are high above our own (Isaiah 55:9).

 Gentleness is not mechanical. It is a gift which only the Holy Spirit can guarantee. It is closely related to wisdom and spiritual growth. In  Galatians 6:1; 2 and 1 Peter 3:15 all used gentleness to describe the way we are to correct or teach others. 

We are to submit our strength, including the strength of our convictions, to God's wisdom. It is not by our knowledge. We are to teach only God's point of view, not our own. And we are to accept that God's actions toward ourselves and others are the right actions, even when human wisdom thinks otherwise! 

We pray that the Holy Spirit will clothe us with the garment of gentleness through Christ our Lord. Amen🙏🏻
28/09/2018, 20:50 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *Concluding Prayer* 

St. Francis, help us in praying for the grace to truly repent for our sins and actively seek reconciliation with God. May the blessings we obtain through your intercession deepen our faith, and inspire us to store treasures in Heaven, where we hope to spend eternity with the Almighty Father. 

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and forever shall be, world without end. Amen 

St. Francis of Assisi, Pray for us! 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

*Matthew* was not engaged in prayer 🙏🏻when Christ called him. He was in a degrading business 😔. He was not listening 👂 to the Savior’s preaching. He was taking from the people, against their will, the taxes for their Roman conqueror. In his own writing ✍, it wasn’t his self who saw Jesus, but, _”as Jesus passed forth from there, He saw a man named Matthew.”_ It wasn’t an ordinary “seeing”-  He was looking at him, He saw all the sin that had been in him, and all the evil that still remained in him. “He saw a man named Matthew.” Christ has a searching look, a discerning look, a detecting look 👁. He must have looked 👀 at him the way he looked at the rich young man that came to Him. He saw everything. His love 💕 looked *goodness* into Matthew and then saw it❗Nobody is totally bad 🤔💭.

 Reflection: 

*His Love looked goodness into Matthew, and then saw it!*

Matthew was still a sinner, a vile one, and a horrible one at the moment Christ saw him. But, rather than see him that way, our Lord's *Love looked goodness "into" him*!!! That is deep. Mathew's goodness was infused, not merited by his works!!! 


Oh My Jesus, when u look at me, please look your goodness and love into my soul, that I, like Mathew, may reflect your love and goodness. Amen.

Day6 - Today, let's pray for *Patient*-
Lord, teach us to be patient – with life, with people, and with ourselves. We sometimes try to hurry things along too much, and we push for answers before the time is right.

Teach us to trust Your sense of timing rather than our own and to surrender our will to Your greater and wiser plan.
Help us let life unfold slowly, and teach us to savor each experience and learn the lessons behind each story.🙏🏻

*Patient*  Is there anything harder than being *patient*?   But waiting is a very active part of our living.

*Waiting On God*

Joyce Meyer said once that “Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting."

This meditation from  Psalms 27 will help you stop minding the time and cast your cares on Him who created time.

Let me pray now that you remember to not lose heart but be *patient* as you encounter the goodness of the Lord around you always. Wait on him.  Be courageous. Wait on him and he will strengthen your heart.

 Now may the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord show you His favor and give you His peace through Christ.  Amen.

In the days ahead you may experience some anxiety in waiting.  Be thankful to God for that awareness and in that moment breathe and be mindful of His presence around you.  There is no waiting because God is already present. And his presence is enough.
 
And consider too how you can be an example of patience to those around you. How might God work through you to be an example of His presence to others?  What a great calling for our world today.

 And in so waiting, expect to encounter God. 
God bless you. Amen

Day7 - Today, let's pray for *Faithfulness*-
May I be as *faithful* to others as you are to me, Lord. Make me steady and dependable, a pillar of strength for those around me as you are for me. So, my *faithfulness* inspires others to put their trust in you.🙏🏻

*Opening Prayer* 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. 

Holy Saint Francis, through your kind intercession we seek holiness above all things. We seek the faith, hope and love that allowed you to joyfully renounce the pleasures of earthly life and to radically follow our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Pray for us that we enjoy the privilege of suffering with and for the poor in the example of Jesus. Help us to be always grateful for the all blessings we have received and the strength to overcome our most pressing concerns, especially… 
(Mention your intentions here)

*Prayer*

Glorious St. Francis, you were untiring in your service to the poor. Obtain for us the same capacity for mercy and desire to give of ourselves that we may one day be considered worthy of the promises of Christ.

01/10/2018, 20:51 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *MEDITATION*

*Faithfulness* entails loyalty, commitment, trust, obedience, keeping to the tenets of an agreement, avoiding backstabbing. For one to claim to be faithful, he must have trust and faith, and must do everything possible to be true to the person or object of his faithfulness. 

As Christians, it behoves us to be faithful to God, faith and the teachings of the church, to our family members, to our friends to our spouses. 

Deuteronomy 10:12-13 enjoins us to fear the Lord, walk in His ways, love Him, serve Him with all our hearts and to keep His commandments and statutes. In the same vein, Ephesians 5:22-25 admonished spouses (husbands and wives) to love each other and to be faithful to their vows, the same way Christ loves and is faithful to the church. 

We stand to gain much when we're faithful both to God and to our fellow humans. *Faithfulness* gives us assurance of walking aright with God and enjoying all the benefits that come with this. It also gives us peace of mind. An unfaithful spouse, for instance, can never have absolute peace of mind because he or she is like a thief, taking what doesn't belong to them them. 

*Faithfulness* also puts us in good stead with our fellow humans, as it portrays us as trustworthy and reliable people. 
  
Let us pray for God's sufficiency of grace so that the fruit of *faithfulness* will always be found in abundance in our lives. May God continue to crown all our little efforts - Amen
01/10/2018, 20:51 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *Concluding Prayer* 

St. Francis, help us in praying for the grace to truly repent for our sins and actively seek reconciliation with God. May the blessings we obtain through your intercession deepen our faith, and inspire us to store treasures in Heaven, where we hope to spend eternity with the Almighty Father. 

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and forever shall be, world without end. Amen 

St. Francis of Assisi, Pray for us! 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

Peace be with you!

Day8 - Today, let's pray for *Self-control*-
Father God give me the strength to control myself. I have my struggles and temptations and I know that Satan will use them against me, help me Lord to have the *self-control* to fight my temptations and remain steady on the path you have set before me. I know that if I give in my feet will fail me and I will stumble. If that happens, Lord, convict my spirit to not continue in my temptations. And, help me, Father, to stand up strong and lean on you to continue in the way set before me.🙏🏻

*Opening Prayer* 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. 

Holy Saint Francis, through your kind intercession we seek holiness above all things. We seek the faith, hope and love that allowed you to joyfully renounce the pleasures of earthly life and to radically follow our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Pray for us that we enjoy the privilege of suffering with and for the poor in the example of Jesus. Help us to be always grateful for the all blessings we have received and the strength to overcome our most pressing concerns, especially… 
(Mention your intentions here)

*Prayer*

Holy St. Francis, you spent your life evangelizing and won over many people to God. We beseech you to have pity on us poor sinners, that through your intercession, God may grant that our doubts be replaced with the certainty that the Holy Spirit will continue to guide us through life’s many trials towards His eternal kingdom.

02/10/2018, 20:54 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *MEDITATION*

Self-control is a Fruit of the Holy Spirit, not a Gift of the Spirit. Gifts are free - fruit must be grown. There's no "spiritual supermarket" where we can buy it so, in most cases, we must do something beyond praying in order for self control to truly bear fruit in our lives. To grow fruit in the natural realm, you have to plant the right seeds and put some work into it. The spiritual realm is not different in that regard. 

Developing self-control is not hard as we may think.  The fruit of the Spirit grows when we cooperate with the Holy Spirit's work in transforming us. Self-control doesn't come easily, but it's definitely within reach. 

2Peter 1:5-7 exhorts us to do just that: "For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, virtue with knowledge, knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with devotion, devotion with mutual affection, mutual affection with love."

*Self-control* a tool to be better self, an umbrella for protection, a  leadership's tie, a mirror of your self, a project and a ladder to greatness. 
  
I pray father, that in my self-control I will hear you more clearly so that you can change me to be more like you. Amen
02/10/2018, 20:54 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *Concluding Prayer* 

St. Francis, help us in praying for the grace to truly repent for our sins and actively seek reconciliation with God. May the blessings we obtain through your intercession deepen our faith, and inspire us to store treasures in Heaven, where we hope to spend eternity with the Almighty Father. 

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and forever shall be, world without end. Amen 

St. Francis of Assisi, Pray for us! 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

“No one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.” - *Luke 9:62*

We often choose certain products, goods and services over others because we trust the brand's reputation for excellence. The key word here is _trust_. God is far more trustworthy than any earthly goods and their inclination to profit. Jesus Christ asks us to follow him in trust, without conditions and with no strings attached because He is worthy of trust. Our following of Christ ought to be radical, immediate and single-minded. The Saints resolved to follow Christ in this manner by doing their daily tasks excellently well (no matter how small). The Christian life entails doing the little things with utmost care and with an eye for perfection. Striving after perfection daily is our way of preparing for heaven our true home. Give your best today to your work, family and everything else that matters to you. In doing this you are putting God's kingdom and it's righteousness first. Everything else shall be added to you.

*Pray*
Holy God, Mighty and Immortal One, give me the grace to heed your call and follow you on the path of righteousness every day.

*Readings*
Job 9:1-16; Psalm 85:10-15; Luke 9 :57-62

We have been discussing about the fruits of the holy spirit from the beginning of of our 9days NOVENA and PEACE is one of them and it's what we need individually, as a group and in world at large.

As Christians and Catholics we can not have PEACE without the holy spirit being active in our lives.

At baptism we received the holy spirit and for holy spirit to remain and bear fruit of PEACE in us we MUST remain united with JESUS CHRIST as he asked us John 16:33.

In the same John 14:27 JESUS promised us his PEACE the kind of PEACE that the world can't give.

JESUS is the Prince of PEACE and once his spirit in us the HOLY SPIRIT  we received at baptism is always active in us we will definitely have in abundant his PEACE which the world can't give. Ephesians 2:14 st.Paul told us that CHRIST himself have brought us PEACE.

Philippians 4:7,9 And God's PEACE which is far beyond human understanding will keep your hearts and minds safe in Union with CHRIST JESUS, in verse 9 he admonished us to put into practice all that we have learnt and received from him both in words and action and the God who gives PEACE will be with us.

My friends in CHRIST, JESUS said in John 15 that he is the vine and you are the branch, cut off from me you can do nothing, so my brothers and sisters in CHRIST let us fan into flame the spirit we received in baptism the HOLY SPIRIT will bear the fruit of PEACE needed in our lives by constant fellowship with brethren, personal prayer, studying the word of God (Bible).
Remember "iron sharpens iron"

May God in his infinite mercy and grace give us the strength, wisdom to always practice all he thought us in words and action and may his PEACE come down upon us, our families and the world at large through CHRIST our Lord Amen.

Bible verses to help us understand more.
Romans 5:1
Romans 15:13&33
2Corinthians 13:11
Colossians 3:15
2Thessanians 3:16
Also Leviticus 26:6
Psalm 29:11
Numbers 6:26 and
Isaiah 32:18.
03/10/2018, 20:51 - ‪+234 706 128 7363‬: *Concluding Prayer* 

St. Francis, help us in praying for the grace to truly repent for our sins and actively seek reconciliation with God. May the blessings we obtain through your intercession deepen our faith, and inspire us to store treasures in Heaven, where we hope to spend eternity with the Almighty Father. 

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and forever shall be, world without end. Amen 

St. Francis of Assisi, Pray for us! 

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

*"Make Me A Channel Of Your Peace"*

Make me a channel of your peace.
Where there is hatred let me bring your Love.
Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord
And where there's doubt, true faith in You.

[Chorus:]
Oh, Master grant that I may never seek
So much to be consoled as to console
To be understood as to understand
To be loved as to love with all my soul.

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there's despair in life, let me bring Hope
Where there is darkness, only light
And where there's sadness, ever joy.

[Chorus:]

Make me a channel of your peace
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
In giving to all men that we receive
And in dying that we're born to eternal Life.
